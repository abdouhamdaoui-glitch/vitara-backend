                  "text": "Every time my husband filed for divorce, he had only one condition: I took all the property, and he only wanted our daughter.\nOn my birthday, I flew across the ocean to surprise them\u2026 and found him having dinner with his true love\u2014my stepsister.\nMy daughter looked at her and said, \u201cMommy.\u201d\nThat day, I finally woke up.\nI drafted the divorce papers, gave up custody, and walked away from it all, building a billion-dollar empire from scratch.\nBut when I returned home one night with a business partner, my ex husband cornered me against the wall.\n\u201cDivorce?\u201d he said, eyes dark. \u201cNot a chance.\u201d\n\nAfter seven years of marriage, my husband, Trevor, fell for another woman\u2014even our daughter wanted her as her new mom.\nI scoffed at the years I\u2019d wasted and handed him the divorce papers. Yet he dropped his usual aloofness, slamming me against the wall,\n\u201cDivorce? Not a chance.\u201d\n***\nWhen Celeste Rodriguez landed at the airport in Andostan, it was already past 9:00 pm.\nIt was her birthday. Her phone buzzed with messages from colleagues and friends\u2014but not a single one from her husband, Trevor Fleming.\nCeleste's smile faded.\nBy the time she reached the villa, it was already past 10:00 pm.\nHannah Lynd, the housekeeper looked startled. \"Mrs. Fleming... what a surprise.\"\n\"Where are Trevor and Jo?\" Celeste asked, handing over her luggage.\n\"Mr. Fleming isn\u2019t back yet. Miss Jordyn\u2019s upstairs playing.\"\nCeleste climbed the stairs. In her room, Jordyn sat in pajamas at her desk, completely absorbed.\n\"Jo?\" Celeste called.\nJordyn turned, her eyes lighting up. In a happy tone, she greeted, \"Mom!\"\nBut then she quickly got back to what she was doing earlier.\nCeleste walked over and hugged her tight, planting a kiss on her cheek. Yet the little one pushed her away and squirmed. \"Mom, I\u2019m busy.\" \nIt had been two months since Celeste last saw Jordyn. She missed her so much that no amount of kisses felt enough. She wanted to talk to Jordyn.\nShe noticed the necklace Jordyn was threading. \"Jo, are you making a seashell necklace?\"\n\"Mm-hm!\" Jordyn perked up visibly. \"Wynn's birthday is in a week. Dad and I picked and polished these ourselves. Pretty, right?\"\nCeleste\u2019s throat tightened. Jordyn didn\u2019t look up, only added brightly, \"Dad even got her a custom gift, tomorrow\u2014\"\nCeleste felt a pang in her chest and couldn't hold back anymore. \"Jo\u2026 Do you remember it's my birthday today?\"\n\"Huh?\" Jordyn glanced up briefly, then quickly looked back down at the string of beads in her hands, She complained, \"Mom, don\u2019t talk, Look, I messed up the bead order\u2014\"\nCeleste stood there in silence for a while, but Jordyn never looked back up. Finally, Celeste pursed her lips and left the room without another word.\nDownstairs, Hannah said, \"I called Mr. Fleming. He said he\u2019s busy tonight and you should rest first.\"\n\"I see.\" Celeste replied softly.\nShe hesitated, then called Trevor. It rang for a while before he answered.\nhis tone was indifferent as usual. \"I'm busy. Let's talk tomorrow\u2014\"\nA woman\u2019s voice chimed in: \"Trevor, who is it?\"\nWynn.\nCeleste gripped the phone tighter.\n\"No one important,\" Trevor answered her.\nBefore Celeste could say anything, Trevor had already hung up.\nCeleste stared at the screen. Two or three months apart, and this was all he had for her.\nAfter so many years of marriage, he\u2019d always been cold. Distant. Impatient. \nShe had got used to chasing after him, calling again, begging for time. Yet tonight, she didn\u2019t bother. \nPerhaps she was just too tired.\n\nThe next morning, Celeste thought it over and decided to call Trevor again.\nThere was a time difference of about 17 or 18 hours between Andostan and their home country. In Andostan, today was her actual birthday.\nShe didn\u2019t just come here for Jordyn. She wanted one thing: a family meal. Her only birthday wish.\nYet, Trevor didn\u2019t answer.\nA long time later, he texted: What\u2019s up?\nShe replied: Lunch today? Just the three of us.\nTrevor answered: Okay. Send the address.\nAlright, she typed back.\nThat was it. No acknowledgment. No \u201cHappy birthday.\u201d She wasn\u2019t surprised. But it still stung.\nAs she headed downstairs, she overheard Jordyn talking with Hannah.\n\"Aren't you happy that Mrs. Fleming is here, sweetie?\" Hannah asked.\n\"Dad and I promised to take Wynn to the beach tomorrow. If Mom comes, it'll be weird. She\u2019s always mean to Wynn.\"\n\"Mrs. Fleming is still your mom, sweetie. That\u2019s hurtful.\"\n\"I know, but Dad and I like Wynn more. Can't Wynn be my mom instead?\"\nCeleste froze.\nShe had raised Jordyn herself most of the time. But over the past two years, the more time Jordyn spent with Trevor, the more attached she became to him. When Trevor came to Andostan to expand his business last year, Jordyn had insisted on coming along.\nCeleste was reluctant and had hoped Jordyn would stay by her side. But she couldn't bear to see Jordyn upset, so she agreed.\nAnd now, Jordyn didn\u2019t even want her as her mom anymore.\nCeleste stood frozen in place, her face pale. To think that she had pushed aside her work to come to Andostan with the intention of spending more time with Jordyn.\nNow, it seemed unnecessary.\nShe walked back to her room, pale and quiet, then repacked the gifts she\u2019d brought.\nLater, Hannah texted: Madame, I took Jordyn out. Let me know if you need anything.\nCeleste sat on the bed, feeling hollow and lost inside. She had abandoned her work and made this trip, only to find no one wanted her here.\nHer arrival was nothing but a joke.\n\nAfter a long while, she left the villa. Aimlessly, she drove around in this foreign yet familiar country.\nBy noon, she remembered she had planned to have lunch with Trevor and Jordyn. As she recalled what she had overheard in the morning, she hesitated about whether to go home and pick up Jordyn. \nThen, a text from Trevor came: Something came up. Lunch\u2019s canceled.\nCeleste stared at it.\nShe should\u2019ve known. Trevor always canceled on her.  His work, friends, and everything else always came before her, his wife.\nOnce, she\u2019d cry. Today, she just felt\u2026 empty.\nCeleste was at an utter loss. She had come all this way excitedly only to be met with indifference from both Trevor and Jordyn.\nAimlessly, she drove around. Eventually, she found herself outside an old favorite restaurant which she and Trevor used to frequent.\nJust as she was about to walk in, she saw them.\nTrevor. Jordyn. Wynn.\nWynn sat next to Jordyn, laughing, feeding the little one the pastries she had taken a bite out of. Jordyn giggled, with her legs swinging around happily. Trevor smiled as he served food to both of them, but his gaze never left Wynn.\nWhat a happy family of three!\nSo this was his \"something came up.\"\nAnd this was the daughter she had carried for ten long months and nearly lost her life to bring into this world.\nCeleste laughed humorlessly. She stood there watching for a long time. Finally, she turned and drove away.\n\nBack at the villa, Celeste drafted the divorce agreement.\nTrevor had been her teenage dream\u2014but he had never truly seen her. If not for that one night and his grandfather Arnold Fleming\u2019s pressure, he never would\u2019ve married her. She thought loving him hard enough would be enough, but seven years proved otherwise.\nFor a long time, she felt lucky to have Jo\u2014her only source of comfort. But now, even Jo didn\u2019t seem to want her.\nThat was it.\nShe was done\u2014with the marriage, the lies, the thankless role of wife and mother. It was time to leave all this behind\u2014and reclaim the promising life she'd given up!\nShe sealed the divorce papers, handed them to Hannah, then grabbed her suitcase and walked out, bound for the airport. On the way, she finally dialed the number she\u2019d been avoiding for months.\nThe line rang once. Twice. A click.\n\u201cHello?\u201d\nShe took a breath, steady and sharp.\u201cThat offer still stand?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d\n...\nAt around 9:00 pm, Trevor and Jordyn returned home.\nJordyn clung to the hem of Trevor's coat and got out of the car sluggishly. Because Celeste was at home, she was reluctant to return that night.\nBut Wynn had said that Celeste came specifically to be with her and Trevor, and if they didn't return, she would be sad. Trevor also said that if they didn't go home that night, Celeste would definitely insist on joining them on their outing to the sea the next day.\nReluctantly, Jordyn agreed to come home.\nStill worried, she muttered gloomily, \"Dad, what if Mom insists on tagging along with us tomorrow?\"\n\"She won't,\" Trevor replied confidently.\nIn all the years they'd been married, Celeste had always tried to find ways to spend more time with him. But she was also sensible. As long as he made his stance clear, she wouldn't dare make him upset.\nIn Jordyn's memory, Celeste always listened to Trevor. Since he said she wouldn't, she felt reassured. As a result, her mood lifted. She made her way into the villa cheerfully and told Hannah she wanted to take a bath.\n\"Sure, sure,\" Hannah replied to Jordyn. Then, she remembered Celeste's instructions and handed an envelope to Trevor. \"Mr. Fleming, this is from Mrs. Fleming. She asked me to give it to you.\"\nTrevor took the envelope and asked casually, \"Where is she?\"\n\"Mrs. Fleming packed up and went back to the country this afternoon. Didn't you know?\" Hannah responded.\nTrevor paused mid-step as he was heading upstairs. He turned back, feeling a little surprised. \"Has she gone back?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nWhy had Celeste suddenly come to Andostan? Trevor hadn't given her a chance to tell him about it. He hadn't cared to ask either. Upon learning she'd left, he didn't dwell on it.\nJordyn was a little surprised too. When she heard the news, she felt a small twinge of disappointment. She'd been thinking that even if Celeste didn't join them for the outing tomorrow, it might be nice to have her around at home in the evening.\nPolishing the seashells made her hands hurt\u2014she had been counting on Celeste's help in finishing the necklace.\nThough it had been months since Trevor and Celeste had seen each other, she had made the effort to visit but only to leave without seeing him in person. Hannah recalled Celeste's grim expression as she left and thought that things felt a little off.\nShe couldn't help but say, \"Mr. Fleming, Mrs. Fleming looked upset when she left. She seemed angry.\"\nHannah had assumed Celeste's sudden departure was due to an urgent matter. Upon realizing Trevor hadn't known she'd left, she began to feel something was amiss.\n\"Angry?\" Trevor repeated in his mind. \nIn his presence, Celeste had always been patient and accommodating. So, she could get angry too? This was new.\nTrevor smiled faintly and responded to Hannah perfunctorily before heading upstairs.\nBack in the bedroom, he was about to open the envelope Celeste had left when Wynn called. After answering the call, he tossed the envelope aside and walked out the door.\nA short while later, the envelope slipped off the bed onto the floor.\nThat night, Trevor didn't return home.\nThe next day, Hannah noticed the envelope on the floor when she was cleaning. Recognizing it as the one Celeste had asked her to hand over, she assumed Trevor had already seen it and placed it in a nearby drawer.\n\u2026\nRight after getting off the plane, Celeste went home and began packing her belongings. She had accumulated quite a few things in the house since she'd been living there for six years, after all. But she only took a few sets of clothes, two sets of daily necessities, and some books that were related to her field of study back in college.\nAfter their marriage, Trevor had been depositing money for her and Jordyn into two separate accounts every month. One account was hers, and the other was Jordyn's.\nHowever, Celeste was used to spending her own money only. She had never touched the money in Jordyn's account. Because she loved Trevor, whenever she went shopping and saw clothes, shoes, cufflinks, or ties that suited him, she couldn't help but buy them.\nIn contrast, she didn't have many expenses on a daily basis because all she did was go to work. Her heart and mind were always focused on Trevor and Jordyn. She wanted to give them the best of everything.\nMost of the money Trevor deposited into her bank account was spent on him and Jordyn.\nGiven this spending pattern, there shouldn't have been much money left in Celeste's account. But over the past year, her opportunities to buy things for Trevor and Jordyn had decreased significantly because they were in Andostan.\nNow, there were over three million dollars in her account. That amount might not matter to Trevor, but to her, it was no small sum. And since it was her money, Celeste didn't hesitate to transfer it out.\nShe left both cards behind, dragged her suitcase out the door, and didn't look back.\nCeleste had an apartment near her workplace, which was a little over 1,100 square feet. She'd bought it four years ago to support a friend who had been struggling to meet their sales targets. She had never lived there before.\nNow, the apartment came in handy. She had it cleaned regularly, so it wasn't dirty. After a quick tidy-up, it was ready to move in.\nAfter a long day, Celeste washed up and went to bed around 10:00 pm.\n\u2026\nThe shrill sound of an alarm jolted Celeste awake. Startled, her mind went blank for a moment.\nWhen she came to her senses, she realized that while it was 1:00 am here, it was 7:00 am in Andostan, where Trevor and Jordyn were. This was their usual breakfast time.\nEver since Jordyn had gone to live with Trevor in Andostan, Celeste had developed the habit of calling her at this time every day. As she was always exhausted from work and was used to going to bed early, she had set this alarm to ensure she wouldn't miss the call.\nAt first, Jordyn hadn't adapted well to living in Andostan and had missed her terribly. She had called Celeste constantly. But as time went on, the calls that used to be full of yearning and dependence had grown perfunctory and impatient.\nThe alarm was no longer necessary. She just hadn't been able to let go.\nSmiling bitterly, Celeste deleted the alarm and turned off her phone before going back to sleep.\n\u2026\nMeanwhile, Trevor and Jordyn were nearly done with breakfast. Though he knew Celeste usually called Jordyn at this time, he wasn't always home and hadn't paid much attention to the routine.\nHe noticed that Celeste hadn't called that day. The fact registered in his mind, but he didn't care. After finishing breakfast, he went upstairs to change.\nJordyn, finding Celeste increasingly annoying, had grown less fond of their calls. Upon realizing that Celeste hadn't called yet, she figured something must have come up.\nShe grabbed her backpack and bolted for the door.\nHannah hurried after her. \"Ms. Fleming, it's still early. There's no rush!\"\nJordyn ignored her and ran to the car happily. She was thrilled that Celeste hadn't called on time that day. If she stayed home, she might still have to talk to Celeste later. Well, she didn't want that!\n\u2026\nAfter getting married to Trevor, Celeste had joined Fleming Group for his sake. Now that she was planning to divorce him, she saw no reason to stay.\nThe next morning, Celeste handed her resignation letter to Zeke Jackson after arriving at the office.\nZeke was one of Trevor's personal secretaries. When he saw Celeste's resignation letter, he was extremely surprised.\nHe was one of the few in the company who knew about the relationship between Celeste and Trevor.\nAnyone familiar with Trevor knew that he didn't love Celeste. So, he had been cold to her and rarely went home after their marriage.\nTo get closer to and win over Trevor, Celeste had chosen to work at Fleming Group.\nHer initial goal was to become his personal secretary, but Trevor refused vehemently. Even when Arnold stepped in, he couldn't get Trevor to agree. In the end, Celeste had to settle for a position in the secretarial team, becoming one of Trevor's many ordinary secretaries.\nAt first, Zeke had worried that Celeste's presence in the secretarial team would create chaos. But to his surprise, she didn't bring them any trouble. Although Celeste used her position to get closer to Trevor, she was mindful of her timing and never overstepped her boundaries. \nOn the contrary, she worked diligently and performed exceptionally well, hoping to gain Trevor's respect. Whether during her pregnancy, childbirth, or any other time, she strictly adhered to company policies and never sought special treatment.\nOver the years, Celeste rose to become the head of the secretarial team. Zeke had observed her feelings for Trevor from the sidelines all the while. To be honest, he had never imagined she would resign one day. He felt skeptical about her willingly giving up her position.\nSomething must have happened between Celeste and Trevor for her to resign now. Zeke understood that this was something he wasn't privy to\u2014it must be something significant enough for Trevor to have ordered her to resign.\nWhile he found it a pity, Zeke maintained a professional tone. \"I acknowledge that I've received your resignation letter. I'll arrange for someone to take over your duties as soon as possible.\"\n\"Alright.\" Celeste nodded and returned to her workstation.\nAfter working for a while, Zeke started an online meeting with Trevor to report on company matters. As the conversation neared its end, he suddenly remembered Celeste's resignation. \n\"Oh, Mr. Fleming, there's one more thing\u2014\"\nAlthough Zeke had told Celeste he would quickly arrange for someone to take over her position, he wanted to gauge Trevor's thoughts on the matter first. If Trevor wanted Celeste out immediately, he would make the arrangements right away.\nBut as the words left his mouth, he remembered that when Celeste first joined the company, Trevor had explicitly stated that all matters regarding her employment should be handled per company regulations. He made it clear that there was no need to report anything to him since he wouldn't concern himself with her.\nAnd indeed, over the years, Trevor had never actively inquired about Celeste's work at the company.\nEven when he encountered her at work, he treated her like she was a complete stranger.\nWhen Celeste was set to be promoted a couple of years ago, the team had hesitated. Everyone was aware of Trevor's dislike for her. They had even brought it up with him to gauge his opinion back then.\nTrevor had frowned in annoyance and reiterated that he wouldn't interfere and that they should handle it according to company policy. He had emphasized that they shouldn't bring up Celeste's matters with him again.\nSeeing Zeke's hesitation, Trevor frowned. \"What is it?\"\nZeke snapped out of his thoughts and quickly replied, \"Oh, it's nothing.\"\nSince Trevor was already aware of Celeste's resignation but hadn't brought it up, it was clear that this matter wasn't important to him. So, Zeke decided to proceed as usual and handle the matter according to company regulations.\nWith that resolved, Trevor ended the call.\n\u2026\n\"What are you thinking about?\" At noon, a colleague patted Celeste on the shoulder.\nCeleste came back to her senses and smiled, shaking her head. \"Nothing.\"\n\"Don't you need to call your daughter today?\"\n\"No, not today.\"\nTypically, she called Jordyn twice a day\u2014once at 1:00 am and once at around 12:00 pm.\nHer colleagues at work were aware of this habit. What they didn't know was her daughter was the child she had with the company's CEO.\nAfter work, Celeste went to the supermarket. She bought some groceries and a few potted plants before heading home.\nAfter dinner, she browsed online for information about the upcoming technology exhibition. \nAfter that, she made a call. \"Please reserve a ticket for next month's tech exhibition for me.\"\n\"Are you sure?\" the person on the other end replied coolly. \"The last two times you asked me to reserve tickets, you didn't show up. Do you know how many people's lifelong dream is to get one of those tickets? You wasted them thoughtlessly.\"\nThe annual tech exhibition was a major event in the industry, and tickets were not easily obtainable.\nTheir company had a limited number of slots, and many IT elites working for them eagerly vied for the opportunity to attend it.\n\"If I don't show up to the exhibition this time, I will never ask you to reserve a ticket for me ever again,\" Celeste promised.\nThere was silence on the other end before the line disconnected. \nCeleste knew that he'd agreed. The corners of her mouth tugged upward into a smile. What she hadn't said was that she wanted to return to the company.\nThough she was one of the partners of her tech firm, she had stepped back during its early days to focus on marriage and family. Her decision had disrupted their development plans and cost them many opportunities.\nHer colleagues had been both angry and frustrated with her. Over the years, they had rarely been in contact.\nWhile Celeste was eager to return, she knew she had been out of the industry for too long. If she went back unprepared, she was worried she wouldn't be able to keep up with the company's current pace.\nSo, she planned to spend some time familiarizing herself with the industry's latest developments before making a concrete decision.\nFor the next few days, Celeste focused on her work during office hours and spent her evenings tending to her own matters. She didn't reach out to Jordyn or Trevor, and they didn't contact her either.\nCeleste wasn't surprised. For over half a year, her communication with them had been one-sided. They had only passively responded to her efforts.\n\u2026\nMeanwhile, in Andostan, Jordyn had developed the habit of calling Wynn first thing every morning.\nThat day, she called Wynn right after waking up as usual. However, the call didn't last long before she burst into tears.\nWynn had told her some bad news. \"I'm going back to the country soon.\"\nDevastated, Jordyn finished the call and immediately phoned Trevor. \"Dad, did you know about this?\"\nAt his office, Trevor flipped through some documents. \"Yes.\"\n\"When did you find out?\"\n\"It's been a while.\"\n\"Dad, you're so mean\u2026\" Jordyn hugged her pink stuffed pig and cried loudly. \"I don't want Wynn to leave. If she's not here, I don't want to go to school here anymore. I want to go back too!\"\nTrevor's tone remained even. \"It's already being arranged.\"\nJordyn didn't understand. \"W-What do you mean?\"\n\"We're going back next week.\"\nJordyn jumped out of bed in excitement. \"Really?\"\n\"Yes, really,\" Trevor replied.\n\"Then why didn't Wynn tell me just now?\"\n\"It was just finalized. She doesn't know yet.\"\nJordyn was ecstatic. \"Dad, let's keep this a secret from Wynn. We'll surprise her when we go back to the country, okay?\"\n\"Alright.\"\n\"You're the best, Dad! I love you so much!\"\nAfter hanging up, Jordyn was still overjoyed. She sang and danced on her bed.\nAfter a while, she suddenly thought of Celeste. For the past few days, she had been in a great mood because Celeste hadn't called her. In fact, to avoid talking to Celeste, she had deliberately left home early and even turned off her phone or kept it far away from her after school.\nBut after two days, she was worried that Celeste might get angry if she found out. So, she stopped doing that. To her surprise, Celeste hadn't called at all in the days that followed.\nAt first, she thought Celeste had discovered that she was deliberately avoiding her calls. But then she remembered that based on past experiences, that wasn't very likely. If Celeste knew she had done something wrong, she would immediately ask Jordyn to correct her wrongdoing instead of sulking and not calling.\nAfter all, she was the most important person to Celeste. Jordyn knew that Celeste loved her the most, so she didn't think that Celeste would purposely refrain from calling her simply because she was upset.\nAs Jordyn thought about this, she suddenly missed Celeste. It was the first time in days she had thought about Celeste, and she couldn't resist dialing Celeste's number.\nBut just as the call connected, she remembered that while she would get to see Wynn after returning to the country, Celeste would undoubtedly try every possible way to prevent her from meeting Wynn. She wouldn't be able to see Wynn whenever she wanted like she could now.\nThis thought dampened Jordyn's mood.\nIt was midnight in Celeste's time zone. She was already asleep when she was woken by the call. Upon seeing Jordyn's name on the screen, she was about to answer when the call abruptly disconnected.\nAlthough Celeste had written in her divorce agreement that she would relinquish custody of Jordyn, she still felt a sense of responsibility as her mother. Worried that something might have happened, Celeste immediately called back.\nWhen Jordyn saw the incoming call, she turned her head away and refused to answer.\nCeleste became more concerned and quickly called the landline at the villa.\nHannah answered promptly. After hearing Celeste's concerns, she reassured her, \"Ms. Fleming should be fine. She went to bed late last night and woke up late today. When I checked earlier, she was still asleep. I'll go upstairs to take a look and call you back.\"\nFeeling relieved, Celeste replied, \"Thank you.\"\nWhen Hannah went upstairs, Jordyn was already in the bathroom brushing her teeth.\nAfter Hannah relayed Celeste being worried about her, Jordyn lowered her head and lied, \"I accidentally hit the call button.\"\nHannah believed her and didn't doubt what she said. Seeing that Jordyn was still brushing her teeth, she went back downstairs to update Celeste that Jordyn was fine.\nJordyn watched as Hannah left. She huffed and finally felt a bit better.\nAfter hearing Hannah's reassurance, Celeste felt relieved too. Still, having been abruptly woken, she struggled to fall back asleep. She wasn't in great shape the next morning at work.\nThe envelope containing the divorce agreement was completely forgotten by Trevor after the phone call with Wynn.\nOn the day they returned to the country, Trevor packed the last document into his briefcase and ensured that nothing was left behind before heading downstairs.\n\"All set. Let's go.\"\nThe Lincoln stretch limousine departed from the villa and headed to the airport.\n\u2026\nThat night, at around 10:00 pm, the plane carrying Trevor and Jordyn landed on time. By the time they got home, it was nearly midnight. \nJordyn had fallen asleep before they arrived. When Trevor carried her upstairs, he passed the master bedroom and noticed the door was open, but the room was pitch black.\nAfter putting Jordyn on her bed and tucking her in, he returned to the master bedroom and turned on the light. Then, he glanced at the bed and found that it was empty\u2014Celeste wasn't there.\nJust then, the butler, Peter Hawk, came upstairs with his luggage. \nLoosening his tie, Trevor asked, \"Where is she?\"\nPeter replied, \"Mrs. Fleming is on a business trip.\"\nHalf a month ago, Peter hadn't been around when Celeste had left with her suitcase. The other maids told him that Celeste left with a suitcase, so he had assumed she was traveling for work.\nNow that he thought about it, this was unusual. Celeste rarely went on business trips. Even when she did, they typically lasted only two or three days.\nThis time, she had been gone for over two weeks.\n\"Alright,\" Trevor responded indifferently, asking no further questions.\n...\nThe next day, Celeste unexpectedly ran into Trevor at the company. She hadn't known that Trevor and Jordyn had returned to the country. Caught off guard by their sudden encounter, Celeste froze mid-step.\nTrevor also seemed slightly surprised to see her, but he assumed she had just returned from the business trip and didn't think much of it.\nHe passed by her coldly, his face expressionless. As usual, he treated her like she was a stranger and turned to enter the building.\nIn the past, if Celeste had found out that he'd suddenly come back, she would have been overjoyed. Even if she couldn't throw herself into his arms in such a scenario, she would have been very happy and excited. Her eyes would light up as she greeted him. \nEven if Trevor remained indifferent, she would have smiled and wished him good morning enthusiastically.\nBut now, Celeste merely glanced at his handsome face before lowering her eyes. There was no longer any trace of the joy and excitement she once felt.\nTrevor didn't notice any of this and was already walking away.\nWatching his tall and composed figure disappear into the building, Celeste wondered when he had returned. Since he was back, perhaps the matter of their divorce could soon be addressed.\nHaving resolved to go through with the divorce, Celeste didn't dwell on him further. After she returned to her workstation, she quickly immersed herself in her work.\nHalf an hour later, Zeke called her and instructed her to do something. \"Prepare two cups of coffee and take them to Mr. Fleming's office.\"\nIn the early days of her marriage, Celeste had learned that Trevor enjoyed coffee. In hopes of winning his favor, she had spent a great deal of effort studying how to brew it perfectly. Her efforts had paid off. After tasting her coffee, Trevor began to specifically request it, both at home and at the office.\nWhen she first realized he genuinely liked the coffee she made, Celeste had been thrilled. She naively believed it was the first step toward gaining his approval.\nBut she had underestimated his dislike and wariness of her. While he liked her coffee, that was all he liked. His attitude toward her remained cold and distant.\nEven when he wanted her coffee, he would have Zeke reach out to her. Once the coffee was prepared, someone else would pick it up for him. He never gave her the opportunity to approach him herself.\nOnly on rare occasions when no one else was available did she get the chance to deliver it to his office personally.\nThis time, it seemed she was to take the coffee directly to Trevor herself from Zeke's tone. After brewing the coffee, Celeste placed the cups on a tray and carried them to his office.\nThe door to his office was ajar.\nAs she approached and was about to knock on the door politely, she saw Wynn sitting on Trevor's lap. The two of them seemed to be locked in a passionate kiss.\nCeleste stopped in her tracks, her face turning pale.\nUpon seeing her, Wynn shot up from Trevor's lap, looking flustered.\nTrevor's expression darkened, and he questioned in an icy tone, \"Who allowed you to come in?\"\n..."

Her phone buzzed with messages from colleagues and friends\u2014but not a single one from her husband, Trevor Fleming.\nCeleste's smile faded.\nBy the time she reached the villa, it was already past 10:00 pm.\nHannah Lynd, the housekeeper looked startled. \"Mrs. Fleming... what a surprise.\"\n\"Where are Trevor and Jo?\" Celeste asked, handing over her luggage.\n\"Mr. Fleming isn\u2019t back yet. Miss Jordyn\u2019s upstairs playing.\"\nCeleste climbed the stairs. In her room, Jordyn sat in pajamas at her desk, completely absorbed.\n\"Jo?\" Celeste called.\nJordyn turned, her eyes lighting up. In a happy tone, she greeted, \"Mom!\"\nBut then she quickly got back to what she was doing earlier.\nCeleste walked over and hugged her tight, planting a kiss on her cheek. Yet the little one pushed her away and squirmed. \"Mom, I\u2019m busy.\" \nIt had been two months since Celeste last saw Jordyn. She missed her so much that no amount of kisses felt enough. She wanted to talk to Jordyn.\nShe noticed the necklace Jordyn was threading. \"Jo, are you making a seashell necklace?\"\n\"Mm-hm!\" Jordyn perked up visibly. \"Wynn's birthday is in a week. Dad and I picked and polished these ourselves. Pretty, right?\"\nCeleste\u2019s throat tightened. Jordyn didn\u2019t look up, only added brightly, \"Dad even got her a custom gift, tomorrow\u2014\"\nCeleste felt a pang in her chest and couldn't hold back anymore. \"Jo\u2026 Do you remember it's my birthday today?\"\n\"Huh?\" Jordyn glanced up briefly, then quickly looked back down at the string of beads in her hands, She complained, \"Mom, don\u2019t talk, Look, I messed up the bead order\u2014\"\nCeleste stood there in silence for a while, but Jordyn never looked back up. Finally, Celeste pursed her lips and left the room without another word.\nDownstairs, Hannah said, \"I called Mr. Fleming. He said he\u2019s busy tonight and you should rest first.\"\n\"I see.\" Celeste replied softly.\nShe hesitated, then called Trevor. It rang for a while before he answered.\nhis tone was indifferent as usual. \"I'm busy. Let's talk tomorrow\u2014\"\nA woman\u2019s voice chimed in: \"Trevor, who is it?\"\nWynn.\nCeleste gripped the phone tighter.\n\"No one important,\" Trevor answered her.\nBefore Celeste could say anything, Trevor had already hung up.\nCeleste stared at the screen. Two or three months apart, and this was all he had for her.\nAfter so many years of marriage, he\u2019d always been cold. Distant. Impatient. \nShe had got used to chasing after him, calling again, begging for time. Yet tonight, she didn\u2019t bother. \nPerhaps she was just too tired.\n\nThe next morning, Celeste thought it over and decided to call Trevor again.\nThere was a time difference of about 17 or 18 hours between Andostan and their home country. In Andostan, today was her actual birthday.\nShe didn\u2019t just come here for Jordyn. She wanted one thing: a family meal. Her only birthday wish.\nYet, Trevor didn\u2019t answer.\nA long time later, he texted: What\u2019s up?\nShe replied: Lunch today? Just the three of us.\nTrevor answered: Okay. Send the address.\nAlright, she typed back.\nThat was it. No acknowledgment. No \u201cHappy birthday.\u201d She wasn\u2019t surprised. But it still stung.\nAs she headed downstairs, she overheard Jordyn talking with Hannah.\n\"Aren't you happy that Mrs. Fleming is here, sweetie?\" Hannah asked.\n\"Dad and I promised to take Wynn to the beach tomorrow. If Mom comes, it'll be weird. She\u2019s always mean to Wynn.\"\n\"Mrs. Fleming is still your mom, sweetie. That\u2019s hurtful.\"\n\"I know, but Dad and I like Wynn more. Can't Wynn be my mom instead?\"\nCeleste froze.\nShe had raised Jordyn herself most of the time. But over the past two years, the more time Jordyn spent with Trevor, the more attached she became to him. When Trevor came to Andostan to expand his business last year, Jordyn had insisted on coming along.\nCeleste was reluctant and had hoped Jordyn would stay by her side. But she couldn't bear to see Jordyn upset, so she agreed.\nAnd now, Jordyn didn\u2019t even want her as her mom anymore.\nCeleste stood frozen in place, her face pale. To think that she had pushed aside her work to come to Andostan with the intention of spending more time with Jordyn.\nNow, it seemed unnecessary.\nShe walked back to her room, pale and quiet, then repacked the gifts she\u2019d brought.\nLater, Hannah texted: Madame, I took Jordyn out. Let me know if you need anything.\nCeleste sat on the bed, feeling hollow and lost inside. She had abandoned her work and made this trip, only to find no one wanted her here.\nHer arrival was nothing but a joke.\n\nAfter a long while, she left the villa. Aimlessly, she drove around in this foreign yet familiar country.\nBy noon, she remembered she had planned to have lunch with Trevor and Jordyn. As she recalled what she had overheard in the morning, she hesitated about whether to go home and pick up Jordyn. \nThen, a text from Trevor came: Something came up. Lunch\u2019s canceled.\nCeleste stared at it.\nShe should\u2019ve known. Trevor always canceled on her.  His work, friends, and everything else always came before her, his wife.\nOnce, she\u2019d cry. Today, she just felt\u2026 empty.\nCeleste was at an utter loss. She had come all this way excitedly only to be met with indifference from both Trevor and Jordyn.\nAimlessly, she drove around. Eventually, she found herself outside an old favorite restaurant which she and Trevor used to frequent.\nJust as she was about to walk in, she saw them.\nTrevor. Jordyn. Wynn.\nWynn sat next to Jordyn, laughing, feeding the little one the pastries she had taken a bite out of. Jordyn giggled, with her legs swinging around happily. Trevor smiled as he served food to both of them, but his gaze never left Wynn.\nWhat a happy family of three!\nSo this was his \"something came up.\"\nAnd this was the daughter she had carried for ten long months and nearly lost her life to bring into this world.\nCeleste laughed humorlessly. She stood there watching for a long time. Finally, she turned and drove away.\n\nBack at the villa, Celeste drafted the divorce agreement.\nTrevor had been her teenage dream\u2014but he had never truly seen her. If not for that one night and his grandfather Arnold Fleming\u2019s pressure, he never would\u2019ve married her. She thought loving him hard enough would be enough, but seven years proved otherwise.\nFor a long time, she felt lucky to have Jo\u2014her only source of comfort. But now, even Jo didn\u2019t seem to want her.\nThat was it.\nShe was done\u2014with the marriage, the lies, the thankless role of wife and mother. It was time to leave all this behind\u2014and reclaim the promising life she'd given up!\nShe sealed the divorce papers, handed them to Hannah, then grabbed her suitcase and walked out, bound for the airport. On the way, she finally dialed the number she\u2019d been avoiding for months.\nThe line rang once. Twice. A click.\n\u201cHello?\u201d\nShe took a breath, steady and sharp.\u201cThat offer still stand?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d\n...\nAt around 9:00 pm, Trevor and Jordyn returned home.\nJordyn clung to the hem of Trevor's coat and got out of the car sluggishly. Because Celeste was at home, she was reluctant to return that night.\nBut Wynn had said that Celeste came specifically to be with her and Trevor, and if they didn't return, she would be sad. Trevor also said that if they didn't go home that night, Celeste would definitely insist on joining them on their outing to the sea the next day.\nReluctantly, Jordyn agreed to come home.\nStill worried, she muttered gloomily, \"Dad, what if Mom insists on tagging along with us tomorrow?\"\n\"She won't,\" Trevor replied confidently.\nIn all the years they'd been married, Celeste had always tried to find ways to spend more time with him. But she was also sensible. As long as he made his stance clear, she wouldn't dare make him upset.\nIn Jordyn's memory, Celeste always listened to Trevor. Since he said she wouldn't, she felt reassured. As a result, her mood lifted. She made her way into the villa cheerfully and told Hannah she wanted to take a bath.\n\"Sure, sure,\" Hannah replied to Jordyn. Then, she remembered Celeste's instructions and handed an envelope to Trevor. \"Mr. Fleming, this is from Mrs. Fleming. She asked me to give it to you.\"\nTrevor took the envelope and asked casually, \"Where is she?\"\n\"Mrs. Fleming packed up and went back to the country this afternoon. Didn't you know?\" Hannah responded.\nTrevor paused mid-step as he was heading upstairs. He turned back, feeling a little surprised. \"Has she gone back?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nWhy had Celeste suddenly come to Andostan? Trevor hadn't given her a chance to tell him about it. He hadn't cared to ask either. Upon learning she'd left, he didn't dwell on it.\nJordyn was a little surprised too. When she heard the news, she felt a small twinge of disappointment. She'd been thinking that even if Celeste didn't join them for the outing tomorrow, it might be nice to have her around at home in the evening.\nPolishing the seashells made her hands hurt\u2014she had been counting on Celeste's help in finishing the necklace.\nThough it had been months since Trevor and Celeste had seen each other, she had made the effort to visit but only to leave without seeing him in person. Hannah recalled Celeste's grim expression as she left and thought that things felt a little off.\nShe couldn't help but say, \"Mr. Fleming, Mrs. Fleming looked upset when she left. She seemed angry.\"\nHannah had assumed Celeste's sudden departure was due to an urgent matter. Upon realizing Trevor hadn't known she'd left, she began to feel something was amiss.\n\"Angry?\" Trevor repeated in his mind. \nIn his presence, Celeste had always been patient and accommodating. So, she could get angry too? This was new.\nTrevor smiled faintly and responded to Hannah perfunctorily before heading upstairs.\nBack in the bedroom, he was about to open the envelope Celeste had left when Wynn called. After answering the call, he tossed the envelope aside and walked out the door.\nA short while later, the envelope slipped off the bed onto the floor.\nThat night, Trevor didn't return home.\nThe next day, Hannah noticed the envelope on the floor when she was cleaning. Recognizing it as the one Celeste had asked her to hand over, she assumed Trevor had already seen it and placed it in a nearby drawer.\n\u2026\nRight after getting off the plane, Celeste went home and began packing her belongings. She had accumulated quite a few things in the house since she'd been living there for six years, after all. But she only took a few sets of clothes, two sets of daily necessities, and some books that were related to her field of study back in college.\nAfter their marriage, Trevor had been depositing money for her and Jordyn into two separate accounts every month. One account was hers, and the other was Jordyn's.\nHowever, Celeste was used to spending her own money only. She had never touched the money in Jordyn's account. Because she loved Trevor, whenever she went shopping and saw clothes, shoes, cufflinks, or ties that suited him, she couldn't help but buy them.\nIn contrast, she didn't have many expenses on a daily basis because all she did was go to work. Her heart and mind were always focused on Trevor and Jordyn. She wanted to give them the best of everything.\nMost of the money Trevor deposited into her bank account was spent on him and Jordyn.\nGiven this spending pattern, there shouldn't have been much money left in Celeste's account. But over the past year, her opportunities to buy things for Trevor and Jordyn had decreased significantly because they were in Andostan.\nNow, there were over three million dollars in her account. That amount might not matter to Trevor, but to her, it was no small sum. And since it was her money, Celeste didn't hesitate to transfer it out.\nShe left both cards behind, dragged her suitcase out the door, and didn't look back.\nCeleste had an apartment near her workplace, which was a little over 1,100 square feet. She'd bought it four years ago to support a friend who had been struggling to meet their sales targets. She had never lived there before.\nNow, the apartment came in handy. She had it cleaned regularly, so it wasn't dirty. After a quick tidy-up, it was ready to move in.\nAfter a long day, Celeste washed up and went to bed around 10:00 pm.\n\u2026\nThe shrill sound of an alarm jolted Celeste awake. Startled, her mind went blank for a moment.\nWhen she came to her senses, she realized that while it was 1:00 am here, it was 7:00 am in Andostan, where Trevor and Jordyn were. This was their usual breakfast time.\nEver since Jordyn had gone to live with Trevor in Andostan, Celeste had developed the habit of calling her at this time every day. As she was always exhausted from work and was used to going to bed early, she had set this alarm to ensure she wouldn't miss the call.\nAt first, Jordyn hadn't adapted well to living in Andostan and had missed her terribly. She had called Celeste constantly. But as time went on, the calls that used to be full of yearning and dependence had grown perfunctory and impatient.\nThe alarm was no longer necessary. She just hadn't been able to let go.\nSmiling bitterly, Celeste deleted the alarm and turned off her phone before going back to sleep.\n\u2026\nMeanwhile, Trevor and Jordyn were nearly done with breakfast. Though he knew Celeste usually called Jordyn at this time, he wasn't always home and hadn't paid much attention to the routine.\nHe noticed that Celeste hadn't called that day. The fact registered in his mind, but he didn't care. After finishing breakfast, he went upstairs to change.\nJordyn, finding Celeste increasingly annoying, had grown less fond of their calls. Upon realizing that Celeste hadn't called yet, she figured something must have come up.\nShe grabbed her backpack and bolted for the door.\nHannah hurried after her. \"Ms. Fleming, it's still early. There's no rush!\"\nJordyn ignored her and ran to the car happily. She was thrilled that Celeste hadn't called on time that day. If she stayed home, she might still have to talk to Celeste later. Well, she didn't want that!\n\u2026\nAfter getting married to Trevor, Celeste had joined Fleming Group for his sake. Now that she was planning to divorce him, she saw no reason to stay.\nThe next morning, Celeste handed her resignation letter to Zeke Jackson after arriving at the office.\nZeke was one of Trevor's personal secretaries. When he saw Celeste's resignation letter, he was extremely surprised.\nHe was one of the few in the company who knew about the relationship between Celeste and Trevor.\nAnyone familiar with Trevor knew that he didn't love Celeste. So, he had been cold to her and rarely went home after their marriage.\nTo get closer to and win over Trevor, Celeste had chosen to work at Fleming Group.\nHer initial goal was to become his personal secretary, but Trevor refused vehemently. Even when Arnold stepped in, he couldn't get Trevor to agree. In the end, Celeste had to settle for a position in the secretarial team, becoming one of Trevor's many ordinary secretaries.\nAt first, Zeke had worried that Celeste's presence in the secretarial team would create chaos. But to his surprise, she didn't bring them any trouble. Although Celeste used her position to get closer to Trevor, she was mindful of her timing and never overstepped her boundaries. \nOn the contrary, she worked diligently and performed exceptionally well, hoping to gain Trevor's respect. Whether during her pregnancy, childbirth, or any other time, she strictly adhered to company policies and never sought special treatment.\nOver the years, Celeste rose to become the head of the secretarial team. Zeke had observed her feelings for Trevor from the sidelines all the while. To be honest, he had never imagined she would resign one day. He felt skeptical about her willingly giving up her position.\nSomething must have happened between Celeste and Trevor for her to resign now. Zeke understood that this was something he wasn't privy to\u2014it must be something significant enough for Trevor to have ordered her to resign.\nWhile he found it a pity, Zeke maintained a professional tone. \"I acknowledge that I've received your resignation letter. I'll arrange for someone to take over your duties as soon as possible.\"\n\"Alright.\" Celeste nodded and returned to her workstation.\nAfter working for a while, Zeke started an online meeting with Trevor to report on company matters. As the conversation neared its end, he suddenly remembered Celeste's resignation. \n\"Oh, Mr. Fleming, there's one more thing\u2014\"\nAlthough Zeke had told Celeste he would quickly arrange for someone to take over her position, he wanted to gauge Trevor's thoughts on the matter first. If Trevor wanted Celeste out immediately, he would make the arrangements right away.\nBut as the words left his mouth, he remembered that when Celeste first joined the company, Trevor had explicitly stated that all matters regarding her employment should be handled per company regulations. He made it clear that there was no need to report anything to him since he wouldn't concern himself with her.\nAnd indeed, over the years, Trevor had never actively inquired about Celeste's work at the company.\nEven when he encountered her at work, he treated her like she was a complete stranger.\nWhen Celeste was set to be promoted a couple of years ago, the team had hesitated. Everyone was aware of Trevor's dislike for her. They had even brought it up with him to gauge his opinion back then.\nTrevor had frowned in annoyance and reiterated that he wouldn't interfere and that they should handle it according to company policy. He had emphasized that they shouldn't bring up Celeste's matters with him again.\nSeeing Zeke's hesitation, Trevor frowned. \"What is it?\"\nZeke snapped out of his thoughts and quickly replied, \"Oh, it's nothing.\"\nSince Trevor was already aware of Celeste's resignation but hadn't brought it up, it was clear that this matter wasn't important to him. So, Zeke decided to proceed as usual and handle the matter according to company regulations.\nWith that resolved, Trevor ended the call.\n\u2026\n\"What are you thinking about?\" At noon, a colleague patted Celeste on the shoulder.\nCeleste came back to her senses and smiled, shaking her head. \"Nothing.\"\n\"Don't you need to call your daughter today?\"\n\"No, not today.\"\nTypically, she called Jordyn twice a day\u2014once at 1:00 am and once at around 12:00 pm.\nHer colleagues at work were aware of this habit. What they didn't know was her daughter was the child she had with the company's CEO.\nAfter work, Celeste went to the supermarket. She bought some groceries and a few potted plants before heading home.\nAfter dinner, she browsed online for information about the upcoming technology exhibition. \nAfter that, she made a call. \"Please reserve a ticket for next month's tech exhibition for me.\"\n\"Are you sure?\" the person on the other end replied coolly. \"The last two times you asked me to reserve tickets, you didn't show up. Do you know how many people's lifelong dream is to get one of those tickets? You wasted them thoughtlessly.\"\nThe annual tech exhibition was a major event in the industry, and tickets were not easily obtainable.\nTheir company had a limited number of slots, and many IT elites working for them eagerly vied for the opportunity to attend it.\n\"If I don't show up to the exhibition this time, I will never ask you to reserve a ticket for me ever again,\" Celeste promised.\nThere was silence on the other end before the line disconnected. \nCeleste knew that he'd agreed. The corners of her mouth tugged upward into a smile. What she hadn't said was that she wanted to return to the company.\nThough she was one of the partners of her tech firm, she had stepped back during its early days to focus on marriage and family. Her decision had disrupted their development plans and cost them many opportunities.\nHer colleagues had been both angry and frustrated with her. Over the years, they had rarely been in contact.\nWhile Celeste was eager to return, she knew she had been out of the industry for too long. If she went back unprepared, she was worried she wouldn't be able to keep up with the company's current pace.\nSo, she planned to spend some time familiarizing herself with the industry's latest developments before making a concrete decision.\nFor the next few days, Celeste focused on her work during office hours and spent her evenings tending to her own matters. She didn't reach out to Jordyn or Trevor, and they didn't contact her either.\nCeleste wasn't surprised. For over half a year, her communication with them had been one-sided. They had only passively responded to her efforts.\n\u2026\nMeanwhile, in Andostan, Jordyn had developed the habit of calling Wynn first thing every morning.\nThat day, she called Wynn right after waking up as usual. However, the call didn't last long before she burst into tears.\nWynn had told her some bad news. \"I'm going back to the country soon.\"\nDevastated, Jordyn finished the call and immediately phoned Trevor. \"Dad, did you know about this?\"\nAt his office, Trevor flipped through some documents. \"Yes.\"\n\"When did you find out?\"\n\"It's been a while.\"\n\"Dad, you're so mean\u2026\" Jordyn hugged her pink stuffed pig and cried loudly. \"I don't want Wynn to leave. If she's not here, I don't want to go to school here anymore. I want to go back too!\"\nTrevor's tone remained even. \"It's already being arranged.\"\nJordyn didn't understand. \"W-What do you mean?\"\n\"We're going back next week.\"\nJordyn jumped out of bed in excitement. \"Really?\"\n\"Yes, really,\" Trevor replied.\n\"Then why didn't Wynn tell me just now?\"\n\"It was just finalized. She doesn't know yet.\"\nJordyn was ecstatic. \"Dad, let's keep this a secret from Wynn. We'll surprise her when we go back to the country, okay?\"\n\"Alright.\"\n\"You're the best, Dad! I love you so much!\"\nAfter hanging up, Jordyn was still overjoyed. She sang and danced on her bed.\nAfter a while, she suddenly thought of Celeste. For the past few days, she had been in a great mood because Celeste hadn't called her. In fact, to avoid talking to Celeste, she had deliberately left home early and even turned off her phone or kept it far away from her after school.\nBut after two days, she was worried that Celeste might get angry if she found out. So, she stopped doing that. To her surprise, Celeste hadn't called at all in the days that followed.\nAt first, she thought Celeste had discovered that she was deliberately avoiding her calls. But then she remembered that based on past experiences, that wasn't very likely. If Celeste knew she had done something wrong, she would immediately ask Jordyn to correct her wrongdoing instead of sulking and not calling.\nAfter all, she was the most important person to Celeste. Jordyn knew that Celeste loved her the most, so she didn't think that Celeste would purposely refrain from calling her simply because she was upset.\nAs Jordyn thought about this, she suddenly missed Celeste. It was the first time in days she had thought about Celeste, and she couldn't resist dialing Celeste's number.\nBut just as the call connected, she remembered that while she would get to see Wynn after returning to the country, Celeste would undoubtedly try every possible way to prevent her from meeting Wynn. She wouldn't be able to see Wynn whenever she wanted like she could now.\nThis thought dampened Jordyn's mood.\nIt was midnight in Celeste's time zone. She was already asleep when she was woken by the call. Upon seeing Jordyn's name on the screen, she was about to answer when the call abruptly disconnected.\nAlthough Celeste had written in her divorce agreement that she would relinquish custody of Jordyn, she still felt a sense of responsibility as her mother. Worried that something might have happened, Celeste immediately called back.\nWhen Jordyn saw the incoming call, she turned her head away and refused to answer.\nCeleste became more concerned and quickly called the landline at the villa.\nHannah answered promptly. After hearing Celeste's concerns, she reassured her, \"Ms. Fleming should be fine. She went to bed late last night and woke up late today. When I checked earlier, she was still asleep. I'll go upstairs to take a look and call you back.\"\nFeeling relieved, Celeste replied, \"Thank you.\"\nWhen Hannah went upstairs, Jordyn was already in the bathroom brushing her teeth.\nAfter Hannah relayed Celeste being worried about her, Jordyn lowered her head and lied, \"I accidentally hit the call button.\"\nHannah believed her and didn't doubt what she said. Seeing that Jordyn was still brushing her teeth, she went back downstairs to update Celeste that Jordyn was fine.\nJordyn watched as Hannah left. She huffed and finally felt a bit better.\nAfter hearing Hannah's reassurance, Celeste felt relieved too. Still, having been abruptly woken, she struggled to fall back asleep. She wasn't in great shape the next morning at work.\nThe envelope containing the divorce agreement was completely forgotten by Trevor after the phone call with Wynn.\nOn the day they returned to the country, Trevor packed the last document into his briefcase and ensured that nothing was left behind before heading downstairs.\n\"All set. Let's go.\"\nThe Lincoln stretch limousine departed from the villa and headed to the airport.\n\u2026\nThat night, at around 10:00 pm, the plane carrying Trevor and Jordyn landed on time. By the time they got home, it was nearly midnight. \nJordyn had fallen asleep before they arrived. When Trevor carried her upstairs, he passed the master bedroom and noticed the door was open, but the room was pitch black.\nAfter putting Jordyn on her bed and tucking her in, he returned to the master bedroom and turned on the light. Then, he glanced at the bed and found that it was empty\u2014Celeste wasn't there.\nJust then, the butler, Peter Hawk, came upstairs with his luggage. \nLoosening his tie, Trevor asked, \"Where is she?\"\nPeter replied, \"Mrs. Fleming is on a business trip.\"\nHalf a month ago, Peter hadn't been around when Celeste had left with her suitcase. The other maids told him that Celeste left with a suitcase, so he had assumed she was traveling for work.\nNow that he thought about it, this was unusual. Celeste rarely went on business trips. Even when she did, they typically lasted only two or three days.\nThis time, she had been gone for over two weeks.\n\"Alright,\" Trevor responded indifferently, asking no further questions.\n...\nThe next day, Celeste unexpectedly ran into Trevor at the company. She hadn't known that Trevor and Jordyn had returned to the country. Caught off guard by their sudden encounter, Celeste froze mid-step.\nTrevor also seemed slightly surprised to see her, but he assumed she had just returned from the business trip and didn't think much of it.\nHe passed by her coldly, his face expressionless. As usual, he treated her like she was a stranger and turned to enter the building.\nIn the past, if Celeste had found out that he'd suddenly come back, she would have been overjoyed. Even if she couldn't throw herself into his arms in such a scenario, she would have been very happy and excited. Her eyes would light up as she greeted him. \nEven if Trevor remained indifferent, she would have smiled and wished him good morning enthusiastically.\nBut now, Celeste merely glanced at his handsome face before lowering her eyes. There was no longer any trace of the joy and excitement she once felt.\nTrevor didn't notice any of this and was already walking away.\nWatching his tall and composed figure disappear into the building, Celeste wondered when he had returned. Since he was back, perhaps the matter of their divorce could soon be addressed.\nHaving resolved to go through with the divorce, Celeste didn't dwell on him further. After she returned to her workstation, she quickly immersed herself in her work.\nHalf an hour later, Zeke called her and instructed her to do something. \"Prepare two cups of coffee and take them to Mr. Fleming's office.\"\nIn the early days of her marriage, Celeste had learned that Trevor enjoyed coffee. In hopes of winning his favor, she had spent a great deal of effort studying how to brew it perfectly. Her efforts had paid off. After tasting her coffee, Trevor began to specifically request it, both at home and at the office.\nWhen she first realized he genuinely liked the coffee she made, Celeste had been thrilled. She naively believed it was the first step toward gaining his approval.\nBut she had underestimated his dislike and wariness of her. While he liked her coffee, that was all he liked. His attitude toward her remained cold and distant.\nEven when he wanted her coffee, he would have Zeke reach out to her. Once the coffee was prepared, someone else would pick it up for him. He never gave her the opportunity to approach him herself.\nOnly on rare occasions when no one else was available did she get the chance to deliver it to his office personally.\nThis time, it seemed she was to take the coffee directly to Trevor herself from Zeke's tone. After brewing the coffee, Celeste placed the cups on a tray and carried them to his office.\nThe door to his office was ajar.\nAs she approached and was about to knock on the door politely, she saw Wynn sitting on Trevor's lap. The two of them seemed to be locked in a passionate kiss.\nCeleste stopped in her tracks, her face turning pale.\nUpon seeing her, Wynn shot up from Trevor's lap, looking flustered.\nTrevor's expression darkened, and he questioned in an icy tone, \"Who allowed you to come in?\"\n..."

                  "text": "Every time my husband filed for divorce, he had only one condition: I took all the property, and he only wanted our daughter.\nOn my birthday, I flew across the ocean to surprise them\u2026 and found him having dinner with his true love\u2014my stepsister.\nMy daughter looked at her and said, \u201cMommy.\u201d\nThat day, I finally woke up.\nI drafted the divorce papers, gave up custody, and walked away from it all, building a billion-dollar empire from scratch.\nBut when I returned home one night with a business partner, my ex husband cornered me against the wall.\n\u201cDivorce?\u201d he said, eyes dark. \u201cNot a chance.\u201d\n\nAfter seven years of marriage, my husband, Trevor, fell for another woman\u2014even our daughter wanted her as her new mom.\nI scoffed at the years I\u2019d wasted and handed him the divorce papers. Yet he dropped his usual aloofness, slamming me against the wall,\n\u201cDivorce? Not a chance.\u201d\n***\nWhen Celeste Rodriguez landed at the airport in Andostan, it was already past 9:00 pm.\nIt was her birthday. Her phone buzzed with messages from colleagues and friends\u2014but not a single one from her husband, Trevor Fleming.\nCeleste's smile faded.\nBy the time she reached the villa, it was already past 10:00 pm.\nHannah Lynd, the housekeeper looked startled. \"Mrs. Fleming... what a surprise.\"\n\"Where are Trevor and Jo?\" Celeste asked, handing over her luggage.\n\"Mr. Fleming isn\u2019t back yet. Miss Jordyn\u2019s upstairs playing.\"\nCeleste climbed the stairs. In her room, Jordyn sat in pajamas at her desk, completely absorbed.\n\"Jo?\" Celeste called.\nJordyn turned, her eyes lighting up. In a happy tone, she greeted, \"Mom!\"\nBut then she quickly got back to what she was doing earlier.\nCeleste walked over and hugged her tight, planting a kiss on her cheek. Yet the little one pushed her away and squirmed. \"Mom, I\u2019m busy.\" \nIt had been two months since Celeste last saw Jordyn. She missed her so much that no amount of kisses felt enough. She wanted to talk to Jordyn.\nShe noticed the necklace Jordyn was threading. \"Jo, are you making a seashell necklace?\"\n\"Mm-hm!\" Jordyn perked up visibly. \"Wynn's birthday is in a week. Dad and I picked and polished these ourselves. Pretty, right?\"\nCeleste\u2019s throat tightened. Jordyn didn\u2019t look up, only added brightly, \"Dad even got her a custom gift, tomorrow\u2014\"\nCeleste felt a pang in her chest and couldn't hold back anymore. \"Jo\u2026 Do you remember it's my birthday today?\"\n\"Huh?\" Jordyn glanced up briefly, then quickly looked back down at the string of beads in her hands, She complained, \"Mom, don\u2019t talk, Look, I messed up the bead order\u2014\"\nCeleste stood there in silence for a while, but Jordyn never looked back up. Finally, Celeste pursed her lips and left the room without another word.\nDownstairs, Hannah said, \"I called Mr. Fleming. He said he\u2019s busy tonight and you should rest first.\"\n\"I see.\" Celeste replied softly.\nShe hesitated, then called Trevor. It rang for a while before he answered.\nhis tone was indifferent as usual. \"I'm busy. Let's talk tomorrow\u2014\"\nA woman\u2019s voice chimed in: \"Trevor, who is it?\"\nWynn.\nCeleste gripped the phone tighter.\n\"No one important,\" Trevor answered her.\nBefore Celeste could say anything, Trevor had already hung up.\nCeleste stared at the screen. Two or three months apart, and this was all he had for her.\nAfter so many years of marriage, he\u2019d always been cold. Distant. Impatient. \nShe had got used to chasing after him, calling again, begging for time. Yet tonight, she didn\u2019t bother. \nPerhaps she was just too tired.\n\nThe next morning, Celeste thought it over and decided to call Trevor again.\nThere was a time difference of about 17 or 18 hours between Andostan and their home country. In Andostan, today was her actual birthday.\nShe didn\u2019t just come here for Jordyn. She wanted one thing: a family meal. Her only birthday wish.\nYet, Trevor didn\u2019t answer.\nA long time later, he texted: What\u2019s up?\nShe replied: Lunch today? Just the three of us.\nTrevor answered: Okay. Send the address.\nAlright, she typed back.\nThat was it. No acknowledgment. No \u201cHappy birthday.\u201d She wasn\u2019t surprised. But it still stung.\nAs she headed downstairs, she overheard Jordyn talking with Hannah.\n\"Aren't you happy that Mrs. Fleming is here, sweetie?\" Hannah asked.\n\"Dad and I promised to take Wynn to the beach tomorrow. If Mom comes, it'll be weird. She\u2019s always mean to Wynn.\"\n\"Mrs. Fleming is still your mom, sweetie. That\u2019s hurtful.\"\n\"I know, but Dad and I like Wynn more. Can't Wynn be my mom instead?\"\nCeleste froze.\nShe had raised Jordyn herself most of the time. But over the past two years, the more time Jordyn spent with Trevor, the more attached she became to him. When Trevor came to Andostan to expand his business last year, Jordyn had insisted on coming along.\nCeleste was reluctant and had hoped Jordyn would stay by her side. But she couldn't bear to see Jordyn upset, so she agreed.\nAnd now, Jordyn didn\u2019t even want her as her mom anymore.\nCeleste stood frozen in place, her face pale. To think that she had pushed aside her work to come to Andostan with the intention of spending more time with Jordyn.\nNow, it seemed unnecessary.\nShe walked back to her room, pale and quiet, then repacked the gifts she\u2019d brought.\nLater, Hannah texted: Madame, I took Jordyn out. Let me know if you need anything.\nCeleste sat on the bed, feeling hollow and lost inside. She had abandoned her work and made this trip, only to find no one wanted her here.\nHer arrival was nothing but a joke.\n\nAfter a long while, she left the villa. Aimlessly, she drove around in this foreign yet familiar country.\nBy noon, she remembered she had planned to have lunch with Trevor and Jordyn. As she recalled what she had overheard in the morning, she hesitated about whether to go home and pick up Jordyn. \nThen, a text from Trevor came: Something came up. Lunch\u2019s canceled.\nCeleste stared at it.\nShe should\u2019ve known. Trevor always canceled on her.  His work, friends, and everything else always came before her, his wife.\nOnce, she\u2019d cry. Today, she just felt\u2026 empty.\nCeleste was at an utter loss. She had come all this way excitedly only to be met with indifference from both Trevor and Jordyn.\nAimlessly, she drove around. Eventually, she found herself outside an old favorite restaurant which she and Trevor used to frequent.\nJust as she was about to walk in, she saw them.\nTrevor. Jordyn. Wynn.\nWynn sat next to Jordyn, laughing, feeding the little one the pastries she had taken a bite out of. Jordyn giggled, with her legs swinging around happily. Trevor smiled as he served food to both of them, but his gaze never left Wynn.\nWhat a happy family of three!\nSo this was his \"something came up.\"\nAnd this was the daughter she had carried for ten long months and nearly lost her life to bring into this world.\nCeleste laughed humorlessly. She stood there watching for a long time. Finally, she turned and drove away.\n\nBack at the villa, Celeste drafted the divorce agreement.\nTrevor had been her teenage dream\u2014but he had never truly seen her. If not for that one night and his grandfather Arnold Fleming\u2019s pressure, he never would\u2019ve married her. She thought loving him hard enough would be enough, but seven years proved otherwise.\nFor a long time, she felt lucky to have Jo\u2014her only source of comfort. But now, even Jo didn\u2019t seem to want her.\nThat was it.\nShe was done\u2014with the marriage, the lies, the thankless role of wife and mother. It was time to leave all this behind\u2014and reclaim the promising life she'd given up!\nShe sealed the divorce papers, handed them to Hannah, then grabbed her suitcase and walked out, bound for the airport. On the way, she finally dialed the number she\u2019d been avoiding for months.\nThe line rang once. Twice. A click.\n\u201cHello?\u201d\nShe took a breath, steady and sharp.\u201cThat offer still stand?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d\n...\nAt around 9:00 pm, Trevor and Jordyn returned home.\nJordyn clung to the hem of Trevor's coat and got out of the car sluggishly. Because Celeste was at home, she was reluctant to return that night.\nBut Wynn had said that Celeste came specifically to be with her and Trevor, and if they didn't return, she would be sad. Trevor also said that if they didn't go home that night, Celeste would definitely insist on joining them on their outing to the sea the next day.\nReluctantly, Jordyn agreed to come home.\nStill worried, she muttered gloomily, \"Dad, what if Mom insists on tagging along with us tomorrow?\"\n\"She won't,\" Trevor replied confidently.\nIn all the years they'd been married, Celeste had always tried to find ways to spend more time with him. But she was also sensible. As long as he made his stance clear, she wouldn't dare make him upset.\nIn Jordyn's memory, Celeste always listened to Trevor. Since he said she wouldn't, she felt reassured. As a result, her mood lifted. She made her way into the villa cheerfully and told Hannah she wanted to take a bath.\n\"Sure, sure,\" Hannah replied to Jordyn. Then, she remembered Celeste's instructions and handed an envelope to Trevor. \"Mr. Fleming, this is from Mrs. Fleming. She asked me to give it to you.\"\nTrevor took the envelope and asked casually, \"Where is she?\"\n\"Mrs. Fleming packed up and went back to the country this afternoon. Didn't you know?\" Hannah responded.\nTrevor paused mid-step as he was heading upstairs. He turned back, feeling a little surprised. \"Has she gone back?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nWhy had Celeste suddenly come to Andostan? Trevor hadn't given her a chance to tell him about it. He hadn't cared to ask either. Upon learning she'd left, he didn't dwell on it.\nJordyn was a little surprised too. When she heard the news, she felt a small twinge of disappointment. She'd been thinking that even if Celeste didn't join them for the outing tomorrow, it might be nice to have her around at home in the evening.\nPolishing the seashells made her hands hurt\u2014she had been counting on Celeste's help in finishing the necklace.\nThough it had been months since Trevor and Celeste had seen each other, she had made the effort to visit but only to leave without seeing him in person. Hannah recalled Celeste's grim expression as she left and thought that things felt a little off.\nShe couldn't help but say, \"Mr. Fleming, Mrs. Fleming looked upset when she left. She seemed angry.\"\nHannah had assumed Celeste's sudden departure was due to an urgent matter. Upon realizing Trevor hadn't known she'd left, she began to feel something was amiss.\n\"Angry?\" Trevor repeated in his mind. \nIn his presence, Celeste had always been patient and accommodating. So, she could get angry too? This was new.\nTrevor smiled faintly and responded to Hannah perfunctorily before heading upstairs.\nBack in the bedroom, he was about to open the envelope Celeste had left when Wynn called. After answering the call, he tossed the envelope aside and walked out the door.\nA short while later, the envelope slipped off the bed onto the floor.\nThat night, Trevor didn't return home.\nThe next day, Hannah noticed the envelope on the floor when she was cleaning. Recognizing it as the one Celeste had asked her to hand over, she assumed Trevor had already seen it and placed it in a nearby drawer.\n\u2026\nRight after getting off the plane, Celeste went home and began packing her belongings. She had accumulated quite a few things in the house since she'd been living there for six years, after all. But she only took a few sets of clothes, two sets of daily necessities, and some books that were related to her field of study back in college.\nAfter their marriage, Trevor had been depositing money for her and Jordyn into two separate accounts every month. One account was hers, and the other was Jordyn's.\nHowever, Celeste was used to spending her own money only. She had never touched the money in Jordyn's account. Because she loved Trevor, whenever she went shopping and saw clothes, shoes, cufflinks, or ties that suited him, she couldn't help but buy them.\nIn contrast, she didn't have many expenses on a daily basis because all she did was go to work. Her heart and mind were always focused on Trevor and Jordyn. She wanted to give them the best of everything.\nMost of the money Trevor deposited into her bank account was spent on him and Jordyn.\nGiven this spending pattern, there shouldn't have been much money left in Celeste's account. But over the past year, her opportunities to buy things for Trevor and Jordyn had decreased significantly because they were in Andostan.\nNow, there were over three million dollars in her account. That amount might not matter to Trevor, but to her, it was no small sum. And since it was her money, Celeste didn't hesitate to transfer it out.\nShe left both cards behind, dragged her suitcase out the door, and didn't look back.\nCeleste had an apartment near her workplace, which was a little over 1,100 square feet. She'd bought it four years ago to support a friend who had been struggling to meet their sales targets. She had never lived there before.\nNow, the apartment came in handy. She had it cleaned regularly, so it wasn't dirty. After a quick tidy-up, it was ready to move in.\nAfter a long day, Celeste washed up and went to bed around 10:00 pm.\n\u2026\nThe shrill sound of an alarm jolted Celeste awake. Startled, her mind went blank for a moment.\nWhen she came to her senses, she realized that while it was 1:00 am here, it was 7:00 am in Andostan, where Trevor and Jordyn were. This was their usual breakfast time.\nEver since Jordyn had gone to live with Trevor in Andostan, Celeste had developed the habit of calling her at this time every day. As she was always exhausted from work and was used to going to bed early, she had set this alarm to ensure she wouldn't miss the call.\nAt first, Jordyn hadn't adapted well to living in Andostan and had missed her terribly. She had called Celeste constantly. But as time went on, the calls that used to be full of yearning and dependence had grown perfunctory and impatient.\nThe alarm was no longer necessary. She just hadn't been able to let go.\nSmiling bitterly, Celeste deleted the alarm and turned off her phone before going back to sleep.\n\u2026\nMeanwhile, Trevor and Jordyn were nearly done with breakfast. Though he knew Celeste usually called Jordyn at this time, he wasn't always home and hadn't paid much attention to the routine.\nHe noticed that Celeste hadn't called that day. The fact registered in his mind, but he didn't care. After finishing breakfast, he went upstairs to change.\nJordyn, finding Celeste increasingly annoying, had grown less fond of their calls. Upon realizing that Celeste hadn't called yet, she figured something must have come up.\nShe grabbed her backpack and bolted for the door.\nHannah hurried after her. \"Ms. Fleming, it's still early. There's no rush!\"\nJordyn ignored her and ran to the car happily. She was thrilled that Celeste hadn't called on time that day. If she stayed home, she might still have to talk to Celeste later. Well, she didn't want that!\n\u2026\nAfter getting married to Trevor, Celeste had joined Fleming Group for his sake. Now that she was planning to divorce him, she saw no reason to stay.\nThe next morning, Celeste handed her resignation letter to Zeke Jackson after arriving at the office.\nZeke was one of Trevor's personal secretaries. When he saw Celeste's resignation letter, he was extremely surprised.\nHe was one of the few in the company who knew about the relationship between Celeste and Trevor.\nAnyone familiar with Trevor knew that he didn't love Celeste. So, he had been cold to her and rarely went home after their marriage.\nTo get closer to and win over Trevor, Celeste had chosen to work at Fleming Group.\nHer initial goal was to become his personal secretary, but Trevor refused vehemently. Even when Arnold stepped in, he couldn't get Trevor to agree. In the end, Celeste had to settle for a position in the secretarial team, becoming one of Trevor's many ordinary secretaries.\nAt first, Zeke had worried that Celeste's presence in the secretarial team would create chaos. But to his surprise, she didn't bring them any trouble. Although Celeste used her position to get closer to Trevor, she was mindful of her timing and never overstepped her boundaries. \nOn the contrary, she worked diligently and performed exceptionally well, hoping to gain Trevor's respect. Whether during her pregnancy, childbirth, or any other time, she strictly adhered to company policies and never sought special treatment.\nOver the years, Celeste rose to become the head of the secretarial team. Zeke had observed her feelings for Trevor from the sidelines all the while. To be honest, he had never imagined she would resign one day. He felt skeptical about her willingly giving up her position.\nSomething must have happened between Celeste and Trevor for her to resign now. Zeke understood that this was something he wasn't privy to\u2014it must be something significant enough for Trevor to have ordered her to resign.\nWhile he found it a pity, Zeke maintained a professional tone. \"I acknowledge that I've received your resignation letter. I'll arrange for someone to take over your duties as soon as possible.\"\n\"Alright.\" Celeste nodded and returned to her workstation.\nAfter working for a while, Zeke started an online meeting with Trevor to report on company matters. As the conversation neared its end, he suddenly remembered Celeste's resignation. \n\"Oh, Mr. Fleming, there's one more thing\u2014\"\nAlthough Zeke had told Celeste he would quickly arrange for someone to take over her position, he wanted to gauge Trevor's thoughts on the matter first. If Trevor wanted Celeste out immediately, he would make the arrangements right away.\nBut as the words left his mouth, he remembered that when Celeste first joined the company, Trevor had explicitly stated that all matters regarding her employment should be handled per company regulations. He made it clear that there was no need to report anything to him since he wouldn't concern himself with her.\nAnd indeed, over the years, Trevor had never actively inquired about Celeste's work at the company.\nEven when he encountered her at work, he treated her like she was a complete stranger.\nWhen Celeste was set to be promoted a couple of years ago, the team had hesitated. Everyone was aware of Trevor's dislike for her. They had even brought it up with him to gauge his opinion back then.\nTrevor had frowned in annoyance and reiterated that he wouldn't interfere and that they should handle it according to company policy. He had emphasized that they shouldn't bring up Celeste's matters with him again.\nSeeing Zeke's hesitation, Trevor frowned. \"What is it?\"\nZeke snapped out of his thoughts and quickly replied, \"Oh, it's nothing.\"\nSince Trevor was already aware of Celeste's resignation but hadn't brought it up, it was clear that this matter wasn't important to him. So, Zeke decided to proceed as usual and handle the matter according to company regulations.\nWith that resolved, Trevor ended the call.\n\u2026\n\"What are you thinking about?\" At noon, a colleague patted Celeste on the shoulder.\nCeleste came back to her senses and smiled, shaking her head. \"Nothing.\"\n\"Don't you need to call your daughter today?\"\n\"No, not today.\"\nTypically, she called Jordyn twice a day\u2014once at 1:00 am and once at around 12:00 pm.\nHer colleagues at work were aware of this habit. What they didn't know was her daughter was the child she had with the company's CEO.\nAfter work, Celeste went to the supermarket. She bought some groceries and a few potted plants before heading home.\nAfter dinner, she browsed online for information about the upcoming technology exhibition. \nAfter that, she made a call. \"Please reserve a ticket for next month's tech exhibition for me.\"\n\"Are you sure?\" the person on the other end replied coolly. \"The last two times you asked me to reserve tickets, you didn't show up. Do you know how many people's lifelong dream is to get one of those tickets? You wasted them thoughtlessly.\"\nThe annual tech exhibition was a major event in the industry, and tickets were not easily obtainable.\nTheir company had a limited number of slots, and many IT elites working for them eagerly vied for the opportunity to attend it.\n\"If I don't show up to the exhibition this time, I will never ask you to reserve a ticket for me ever again,\" Celeste promised.\nThere was silence on the other end before the line disconnected. \nCeleste knew that he'd agreed. The corners of her mouth tugged upward into a smile. What she hadn't said was that she wanted to return to the company.\nThough she was one of the partners of her tech firm, she had stepped back during its early days to focus on marriage and family. Her decision had disrupted their development plans and cost them many opportunities.\nHer colleagues had been both angry and frustrated with her. Over the years, they had rarely been in contact.\nWhile Celeste was eager to return, she knew she had been out of the industry for too long. If she went back unprepared, she was worried she wouldn't be able to keep up with the company's current pace.\nSo, she planned to spend some time familiarizing herself with the industry's latest developments before making a concrete decision.\nFor the next few days, Celeste focused on her work during office hours and spent her evenings tending to her own matters. She didn't reach out to Jordyn or Trevor, and they didn't contact her either.\nCeleste wasn't surprised. For over half a year, her communication with them had been one-sided. They had only passively responded to her efforts.\n\u2026\nMeanwhile, in Andostan, Jordyn had developed the habit of calling Wynn first thing every morning.\nThat day, she called Wynn right after waking up as usual. However, the call didn't last long before she burst into tears.\nWynn had told her some bad news. \"I'm going back to the country soon.\"\nDevastated, Jordyn finished the call and immediately phoned Trevor. \"Dad, did you know about this?\"\nAt his office, Trevor flipped through some documents. \"Yes.\"\n\"When did you find out?\"\n\"It's been a while.\"\n\"Dad, you're so mean\u2026\" Jordyn hugged her pink stuffed pig and cried loudly. \"I don't want Wynn to leave. If she's not here, I don't want to go to school here anymore. I want to go back too!\"\nTrevor's tone remained even. \"It's already being arranged.\"\nJordyn didn't understand. \"W-What do you mean?\"\n\"We're going back next week.\"\nJordyn jumped out of bed in excitement. \"Really?\"\n\"Yes, really,\" Trevor replied.\n\"Then why didn't Wynn tell me just now?\"\n\"It was just finalized. She doesn't know yet.\"\nJordyn was ecstatic. \"Dad, let's keep this a secret from Wynn. We'll surprise her when we go back to the country, okay?\"\n\"Alright.\"\n\"You're the best, Dad! I love you so much!\"\nAfter hanging up, Jordyn was still overjoyed. She sang and danced on her bed.\nAfter a while, she suddenly thought of Celeste. For the past few days, she had been in a great mood because Celeste hadn't called her. In fact, to avoid talking to Celeste, she had deliberately left home early and even turned off her phone or kept it far away from her after school.\nBut after two days, she was worried that Celeste might get angry if she found out. So, she stopped doing that. To her surprise, Celeste hadn't called at all in the days that followed.\nAt first, she thought Celeste had discovered that she was deliberately avoiding her calls. But then she remembered that based on past experiences, that wasn't very likely. If Celeste knew she had done something wrong, she would immediately ask Jordyn to correct her wrongdoing instead of sulking and not calling.\nAfter all, she was the most important person to Celeste. Jordyn knew that Celeste loved her the most, so she didn't think that Celeste would purposely refrain from calling her simply because she was upset.\nAs Jordyn thought about this, she suddenly missed Celeste. It was the first time in days she had thought about Celeste, and she couldn't resist dialing Celeste's number.\nBut just as the call connected, she remembered that while she would get to see Wynn after returning to the country, Celeste would undoubtedly try every possible way to prevent her from meeting Wynn. She wouldn't be able to see Wynn whenever she wanted like she could now.\nThis thought dampened Jordyn's mood.\nIt was midnight in Celeste's time zone. She was already asleep when she was woken by the call. Upon seeing Jordyn's name on the screen, she was about to answer when the call abruptly disconnected.\nAlthough Celeste had written in her divorce agreement that she would relinquish custody of Jordyn, she still felt a sense of responsibility as her mother. Worried that something might have happened, Celeste immediately called back.\nWhen Jordyn saw the incoming call, she turned her head away and refused to answer.\nCeleste became more concerned and quickly called the landline at the villa.\nHannah answered promptly. After hearing Celeste's concerns, she reassured her, \"Ms. Fleming should be fine. She went to bed late last night and woke up late today. When I checked earlier, she was still asleep. I'll go upstairs to take a look and call you back.\"\nFeeling relieved, Celeste replied, \"Thank you.\"\nWhen Hannah went upstairs, Jordyn was already in the bathroom brushing her teeth.\nAfter Hannah relayed Celeste being worried about her, Jordyn lowered her head and lied, \"I accidentally hit the call button.\"\nHannah believed her and didn't doubt what she said. Seeing that Jordyn was still brushing her teeth, she went back downstairs to update Celeste that Jordyn was fine.\nJordyn watched as Hannah left. She huffed and finally felt a bit better.\nAfter hearing Hannah's reassurance, Celeste felt relieved too. Still, having been abruptly woken, she struggled to fall back asleep. She wasn't in great shape the next morning at work.\nThe envelope containing the divorce agreement was completely forgotten by Trevor after the phone call with Wynn.\nOn the day they returned to the country, Trevor packed the last document into his briefcase and ensured that nothing was left behind before heading downstairs.\n\"All set. Let's go.\"\nThe Lincoln stretch limousine departed from the villa and headed to the airport.\n\u2026\nThat night, at around 10:00 pm, the plane carrying Trevor and Jordyn landed on time. By the time they got home, it was nearly midnight. \nJordyn had fallen asleep before they arrived. When Trevor carried her upstairs, he passed the master bedroom and noticed the door was open, but the room was pitch black.\nAfter putting Jordyn on her bed and tucking her in, he returned to the master bedroom and turned on the light. Then, he glanced at the bed and found that it was empty\u2014Celeste wasn't there.\nJust then, the butler, Peter Hawk, came upstairs with his luggage. \nLoosening his tie, Trevor asked, \"Where is she?\"\nPeter replied, \"Mrs. Fleming is on a business trip.\"\nHalf a month ago, Peter hadn't been around when Celeste had left with her suitcase. The other maids told him that Celeste left with a suitcase, so he had assumed she was traveling for work.\nNow that he thought about it, this was unusual. Celeste rarely went on business trips. Even when she did, they typically lasted only two or three days.\nThis time, she had been gone for over two weeks.\n\"Alright,\" Trevor responded indifferently, asking no further questions.\n...\nThe next day, Celeste unexpectedly ran into Trevor at the company. She hadn't known that Trevor and Jordyn had returned to the country. Caught off guard by their sudden encounter, Celeste froze mid-step.\nTrevor also seemed slightly surprised to see her, but he assumed she had just returned from the business trip and didn't think much of it.\nHe passed by her coldly, his face expressionless. As usual, he treated her like she was a stranger and turned to enter the building.\nIn the past, if Celeste had found out that he'd suddenly come back, she would have been overjoyed. Even if she couldn't throw herself into his arms in such a scenario, she would have been very happy and excited. Her eyes would light up as she greeted him. \nEven if Trevor remained indifferent, she would have smiled and wished him good morning enthusiastically.\nBut now, Celeste merely glanced at his handsome face before lowering her eyes. There was no longer any trace of the joy and excitement she once felt.\nTrevor didn't notice any of this and was already walking away.\nWatching his tall and composed figure disappear into the building, Celeste wondered when he had returned. Since he was back, perhaps the matter of their divorce could soon be addressed.\nHaving resolved to go through with the divorce, Celeste didn't dwell on him further. After she returned to her workstation, she quickly immersed herself in her work.\nHalf an hour later, Zeke called her and instructed her to do something. \"Prepare two cups of coffee and take them to Mr. Fleming's office.\"\nIn the early days of her marriage, Celeste had learned that Trevor enjoyed coffee. In hopes of winning his favor, she had spent a great deal of effort studying how to brew it perfectly. Her efforts had paid off. After tasting her coffee, Trevor began to specifically request it, both at home and at the office.\nWhen she first realized he genuinely liked the coffee she made, Celeste had been thrilled. She naively believed it was the first step toward gaining his approval.\nBut she had underestimated his dislike and wariness of her. While he liked her coffee, that was all he liked. His attitude toward her remained cold and distant.\nEven when he wanted her coffee, he would have Zeke reach out to her. Once the coffee was prepared, someone else would pick it up for him. He never gave her the opportunity to approach him herself.\nOnly on rare occasions when no one else was available did she get the chance to deliver it to his office personally.\nThis time, it seemed she was to take the coffee directly to Trevor herself from Zeke's tone. After brewing the coffee, Celeste placed the cups on a tray and carried them to his office.\nThe door to his office was ajar.\nAs she approached and was about to knock on the door politely, she saw Wynn sitting on Trevor's lap. The two of them seemed to be locked in a passionate kiss.\nCeleste stopped in her tracks, her face turning pale.\nUpon seeing her, Wynn shot up from Trevor's lap, looking flustered.\nTrevor's expression darkened, and he questioned in an icy tone, \"Who allowed you to come in?\"\n..."

                  "text": "Every time my husband filed for divorce, he had only one condition: I took all the property, and he only wanted our daughter.\nOn my birthday, I flew across the ocean to surprise them\u2026 and found him having dinner with his true love\u2014my stepsister.\nMy daughter looked at her and said, \u201cMommy.\u201d\nThat day, I finally woke up.\nI drafted the divorce papers, gave up custody, and walked away from it all, building a billion-dollar empire from scratch.\nBut when I returned home one night with a business partner, my ex husband cornered me against the wall.\n\u201cDivorce?\u201d he said, eyes dark. \u201cNot a chance.\u201d\n\nAfter seven years of marriage, my husband, Trevor, fell for another woman\u2014even our daughter wanted her as her new mom.\nI scoffed at the years I\u2019d wasted and handed him the divorce papers. Yet he dropped his usual aloofness, slamming me against the wall,\n\u201cDivorce? Not a chance.\u201d\n***\nWhen Celeste Rodriguez landed at the airport in Andostan, it was already past 9:00 pm.\nIt was her birthday. Her phone buzzed with messages from colleagues and friends\u2014but not a single one from her husband, Trevor Fleming.\nCeleste's smile faded.\nBy the time she reached the villa, it was already past 10:00 pm.\nHannah Lynd, the housekeeper looked startled. \"Mrs. Fleming... what a surprise.\"\n\"Where are Trevor and Jo?\" Celeste asked, handing over her luggage.\n\"Mr. Fleming isn\u2019t back yet. Miss Jordyn\u2019s upstairs playing.\"\nCeleste climbed the stairs. In her room, Jordyn sat in pajamas at her desk, completely absorbed.\n\"Jo?\" Celeste called.\nJordyn turned, her eyes lighting up. In a happy tone, she greeted, \"Mom!\"\nBut then she quickly got back to what she was doing earlier.\nCeleste walked over and hugged her tight, planting a kiss on her cheek. Yet the little one pushed her away and squirmed. \"Mom, I\u2019m busy.\" \nIt had been two months since Celeste last saw Jordyn. She missed her so much that no amount of kisses felt enough. She wanted to talk to Jordyn.\nShe noticed the necklace Jordyn was threading. \"Jo, are you making a seashell necklace?\"\n\"Mm-hm!\" Jordyn perked up visibly. \"Wynn's birthday is in a week. Dad and I picked and polished these ourselves. Pretty, right?\"\nCeleste\u2019s throat tightened. Jordyn didn\u2019t look up, only added brightly, \"Dad even got her a custom gift, tomorrow\u2014\"\nCeleste felt a pang in her chest and couldn't hold back anymore. \"Jo\u2026 Do you remember it's my birthday today?\"\n\"Huh?\" Jordyn glanced up briefly, then quickly looked back down at the string of beads in her hands, She complained, \"Mom, don\u2019t talk, Look, I messed up the bead order\u2014\"\nCeleste stood there in silence for a while, but Jordyn never looked back up. Finally, Celeste pursed her lips and left the room without another word.\nDownstairs, Hannah said, \"I called Mr. Fleming. He said he\u2019s busy tonight and you should rest first.\"\n\"I see.\" Celeste replied softly.\nShe hesitated, then called Trevor. It rang for a while before he answered.\nhis tone was indifferent as usual. \"I'm busy. Let's talk tomorrow\u2014\"\nA woman\u2019s voice chimed in: \"Trevor, who is it?\"\nWynn.\nCeleste gripped the phone tighter.\n\"No one important,\" Trevor answered her.\nBefore Celeste could say anything, Trevor had already hung up.\nCeleste stared at the screen. Two or three months apart, and this was all he had for her.\nAfter so many years of marriage, he\u2019d always been cold. Distant. Impatient. \nShe had got used to chasing after him, calling again, begging for time. Yet tonight, she didn\u2019t bother. \nPerhaps she was just too tired.\n\nThe next morning, Celeste thought it over and decided to call Trevor again.\nThere was a time difference of about 17 or 18 hours between Andostan and their home country. In Andostan, today was her actual birthday.\nShe didn\u2019t just come here for Jordyn. She wanted one thing: a family meal. Her only birthday wish.\nYet, Trevor didn\u2019t answer.\nA long time later, he texted: What\u2019s up?\nShe replied: Lunch today? Just the three of us.\nTrevor answered: Okay. Send the address.\nAlright, she typed back.\nThat was it. No acknowledgment. No \u201cHappy birthday.\u201d She wasn\u2019t surprised. But it still stung.\nAs she headed downstairs, she overheard Jordyn talking with Hannah.\n\"Aren't you happy that Mrs. Fleming is here, sweetie?\" Hannah asked.\n\"Dad and I promised to take Wynn to the beach tomorrow. If Mom comes, it'll be weird. She\u2019s always mean to Wynn.\"\n\"Mrs. Fleming is still your mom, sweetie. That\u2019s hurtful.\"\n\"I know, but Dad and I like Wynn more. Can't Wynn be my mom instead?\"\nCeleste froze.\nShe had raised Jordyn herself most of the time. But over the past two years, the more time Jordyn spent with Trevor, the more attached she became to him. When Trevor came to Andostan to expand his business last year, Jordyn had insisted on coming along.\nCeleste was reluctant and had hoped Jordyn would stay by her side. But she couldn't bear to see Jordyn upset, so she agreed.\nAnd now, Jordyn didn\u2019t even want her as her mom anymore.\nCeleste stood frozen in place, her face pale. To think that she had pushed aside her work to come to Andostan with the intention of spending more time with Jordyn.\nNow, it seemed unnecessary.\nShe walked back to her room, pale and quiet, then repacked the gifts she\u2019d brought.\nLater, Hannah texted: Madame, I took Jordyn out. Let me know if you need anything.\nCeleste sat on the bed, feeling hollow and lost inside. She had abandoned her work and made this trip, only to find no one wanted her here.\nHer arrival was nothing but a joke.\n\nAfter a long while, she left the villa. Aimlessly, she drove around in this foreign yet familiar country.\nBy noon, she remembered she had planned to have lunch with Trevor and Jordyn. As she recalled what she had overheard in the morning, she hesitated about whether to go home and pick up Jordyn. \nThen, a text from Trevor came: Something came up. Lunch\u2019s canceled.\nCeleste stared at it.\nShe should\u2019ve known. Trevor always canceled on her.  His work, friends, and everything else always came before her, his wife.\nOnce, she\u2019d cry. Today, she just felt\u2026 empty.\nCeleste was at an utter loss. She had come all this way excitedly only to be met with indifference from both Trevor and Jordyn.\nAimlessly, she drove around. Eventually, she found herself outside an old favorite restaurant which she and Trevor used to frequent.\nJust as she was about to walk in, she saw them.\nTrevor. Jordyn. Wynn.\nWynn sat next to Jordyn, laughing, feeding the little one the pastries she had taken a bite out of. Jordyn giggled, with her legs swinging around happily. Trevor smiled as he served food to both of them, but his gaze never left Wynn.\nWhat a happy family of three!\nSo this was his \"something came up.\"\nAnd this was the daughter she had carried for ten long months and nearly lost her life to bring into this world.\nCeleste laughed humorlessly. She stood there watching for a long time. Finally, she turned and drove away.\n\nBack at the villa, Celeste drafted the divorce agreement.\nTrevor had been her teenage dream\u2014but he had never truly seen her. If not for that one night and his grandfather Arnold Fleming\u2019s pressure, he never would\u2019ve married her. She thought loving him hard enough would be enough, but seven years proved otherwise.\nFor a long time, she felt lucky to have Jo\u2014her only source of comfort. But now, even Jo didn\u2019t seem to want her.\nThat was it.\nShe was done\u2014with the marriage, the lies, the thankless role of wife and mother. It was time to leave all this behind\u2014and reclaim the promising life she'd given up!\nShe sealed the divorce papers, handed them to Hannah, then grabbed her suitcase and walked out, bound for the airport. On the way, she finally dialed the number she\u2019d been avoiding for months.\nThe line rang once. Twice. A click.\n\u201cHello?\u201d\nShe took a breath, steady and sharp.\u201cThat offer still stand?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d\n...\nAt around 9:00 pm, Trevor and Jordyn returned home.\nJordyn clung to the hem of Trevor's coat and got out of the car sluggishly. Because Celeste was at home, she was reluctant to return that night.\nBut Wynn had said that Celeste came specifically to be with her and Trevor, and if they didn't return, she would be sad. Trevor also said that if they didn't go home that night, Celeste would definitely insist on joining them on their outing to the sea the next day.\nReluctantly, Jordyn agreed to come home.\nStill worried, she muttered gloomily, \"Dad, what if Mom insists on tagging along with us tomorrow?\"\n\"She won't,\" Trevor replied confidently.\nIn all the years they'd been married, Celeste had always tried to find ways to spend more time with him. But she was also sensible. As long as he made his stance clear, she wouldn't dare make him upset.\nIn Jordyn's memory, Celeste always listened to Trevor. Since he said she wouldn't, she felt reassured. As a result, her mood lifted. She made her way into the villa cheerfully and told Hannah she wanted to take a bath.\n\"Sure, sure,\" Hannah replied to Jordyn. Then, she remembered Celeste's instructions and handed an envelope to Trevor. \"Mr. Fleming, this is from Mrs. Fleming. She asked me to give it to you.\"\nTrevor took the envelope and asked casually, \"Where is she?\"\n\"Mrs. Fleming packed up and went back to the country this afternoon. Didn't you know?\" Hannah responded.\nTrevor paused mid-step as he was heading upstairs. He turned back, feeling a little surprised. \"Has she gone back?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nWhy had Celeste suddenly come to Andostan? Trevor hadn't given her a chance to tell him about it. He hadn't cared to ask either. Upon learning she'd left, he didn't dwell on it.\nJordyn was a little surprised too. When she heard the news, she felt a small twinge of disappointment. She'd been thinking that even if Celeste didn't join them for the outing tomorrow, it might be nice to have her around at home in the evening.\nPolishing the seashells made her hands hurt\u2014she had been counting on Celeste's help in finishing the necklace.\nThough it had been months since Trevor and Celeste had seen each other, she had made the effort to visit but only to leave without seeing him in person. Hannah recalled Celeste's grim expression as she left and thought that things felt a little off.\nShe couldn't help but say, \"Mr. Fleming, Mrs. Fleming looked upset when she left. She seemed angry.\"\nHannah had assumed Celeste's sudden departure was due to an urgent matter. Upon realizing Trevor hadn't known she'd left, she began to feel something was amiss.\n\"Angry?\" Trevor repeated in his mind. \nIn his presence, Celeste had always been patient and accommodating. So, she could get angry too? This was new.\nTrevor smiled faintly and responded to Hannah perfunctorily before heading upstairs.\nBack in the bedroom, he was about to open the envelope Celeste had left when Wynn called. After answering the call, he tossed the envelope aside and walked out the door.\nA short while later, the envelope slipped off the bed onto the floor.\nThat night, Trevor didn't return home.\nThe next day, Hannah noticed the envelope on the floor when she was cleaning. Recognizing it as the one Celeste had asked her to hand over, she assumed Trevor had already seen it and placed it in a nearby drawer.\n\u2026\nRight after getting off the plane, Celeste went home and began packing her belongings. She had accumulated quite a few things in the house since she'd been living there for six years, after all. But she only took a few sets of clothes, two sets of daily necessities, and some books that were related to her field of study back in college.\nAfter their marriage, Trevor had been depositing money for her and Jordyn into two separate accounts every month. One account was hers, and the other was Jordyn's.\nHowever, Celeste was used to spending her own money only. She had never touched the money in Jordyn's account. Because she loved Trevor, whenever she went shopping and saw clothes, shoes, cufflinks, or ties that suited him, she couldn't help but buy them.\nIn contrast, she didn't have many expenses on a daily basis because all she did was go to work. Her heart and mind were always focused on Trevor and Jordyn. She wanted to give them the best of everything.\nMost of the money Trevor deposited into her bank account was spent on him and Jordyn.\nGiven this spending pattern, there shouldn't have been much money left in Celeste's account. But over the past year, her opportunities to buy things for Trevor and Jordyn had decreased significantly because they were in Andostan.\nNow, there were over three million dollars in her account. That amount might not matter to Trevor, but to her, it was no small sum. And since it was her money, Celeste didn't hesitate to transfer it out.\nShe left both cards behind, dragged her suitcase out the door, and didn't look back.\nCeleste had an apartment near her workplace, which was a little over 1,100 square feet. She'd bought it four years ago to support a friend who had been struggling to meet their sales targets. She had never lived there before.\nNow, the apartment came in handy. She had it cleaned regularly, so it wasn't dirty. After a quick tidy-up, it was ready to move in.\nAfter a long day, Celeste washed up and went to bed around 10:00 pm.\n\u2026\nThe shrill sound of an alarm jolted Celeste awake. Startled, her mind went blank for a moment.\nWhen she came to her senses, she realized that while it was 1:00 am here, it was 7:00 am in Andostan, where Trevor and Jordyn were. This was their usual breakfast time.\nEver since Jordyn had gone to live with Trevor in Andostan, Celeste had developed the habit of calling her at this time every day. As she was always exhausted from work and was used to going to bed early, she had set this alarm to ensure she wouldn't miss the call.\nAt first, Jordyn hadn't adapted well to living in Andostan and had missed her terribly. She had called Celeste constantly. But as time went on, the calls that used to be full of yearning and dependence had grown perfunctory and impatient.\nThe alarm was no longer necessary. She just hadn't been able to let go.\nSmiling bitterly, Celeste deleted the alarm and turned off her phone before going back to sleep.\n\u2026\nMeanwhile, Trevor and Jordyn were nearly done with breakfast. Though he knew Celeste usually called Jordyn at this time, he wasn't always home and hadn't paid much attention to the routine.\nHe noticed that Celeste hadn't called that day. The fact registered in his mind, but he didn't care. After finishing breakfast, he went upstairs to change.\nJordyn, finding Celeste increasingly annoying, had grown less fond of their calls. Upon realizing that Celeste hadn't called yet, she figured something must have come up.\nShe grabbed her backpack and bolted for the door.\nHannah hurried after her. \"Ms. Fleming, it's still early. There's no rush!\"\nJordyn ignored her and ran to the car happily. She was thrilled that Celeste hadn't called on time that day. If she stayed home, she might still have to talk to Celeste later. Well, she didn't want that!\n\u2026\nAfter getting married to Trevor, Celeste had joined Fleming Group for his sake. Now that she was planning to divorce him, she saw no reason to stay.\nThe next morning, Celeste handed her resignation letter to Zeke Jackson after arriving at the office.\nZeke was one of Trevor's personal secretaries. When he saw Celeste's resignation letter, he was extremely surprised.\nHe was one of the few in the company who knew about the relationship between Celeste and Trevor.\nAnyone familiar with Trevor knew that he didn't love Celeste. So, he had been cold to her and rarely went home after their marriage.\nTo get closer to and win over Trevor, Celeste had chosen to work at Fleming Group.\nHer initial goal was to become his personal secretary, but Trevor refused vehemently. Even when Arnold stepped in, he couldn't get Trevor to agree. In the end, Celeste had to settle for a position in the secretarial team, becoming one of Trevor's many ordinary secretaries.\nAt first, Zeke had worried that Celeste's presence in the secretarial team would create chaos. But to his surprise, she didn't bring them any trouble. Although Celeste used her position to get closer to Trevor, she was mindful of her timing and never overstepped her boundaries. \nOn the contrary, she worked diligently and performed exceptionally well, hoping to gain Trevor's respect. Whether during her pregnancy, childbirth, or any other time, she strictly adhered to company policies and never sought special treatment.\nOver the years, Celeste rose to become the head of the secretarial team. Zeke had observed her feelings for Trevor from the sidelines all the while. To be honest, he had never imagined she would resign one day. He felt skeptical about her willingly giving up her position.\nSomething must have happened between Celeste and Trevor for her to resign now. Zeke understood that this was something he wasn't privy to\u2014it must be something significant enough for Trevor to have ordered her to resign.\nWhile he found it a pity, Zeke maintained a professional tone. \"I acknowledge that I've received your resignation letter. I'll arrange for someone to take over your duties as soon as possible.\"\n\"Alright.\" Celeste nodded and returned to her workstation.\nAfter working for a while, Zeke started an online meeting with Trevor to report on company matters. As the conversation neared its end, he suddenly remembered Celeste's resignation. \n\"Oh, Mr. Fleming, there's one more thing\u2014\"\nAlthough Zeke had told Celeste he would quickly arrange for someone to take over her position, he wanted to gauge Trevor's thoughts on the matter first. If Trevor wanted Celeste out immediately, he would make the arrangements right away.\nBut as the words left his mouth, he remembered that when Celeste first joined the company, Trevor had explicitly stated that all matters regarding her employment should be handled per company regulations. He made it clear that there was no need to report anything to him since he wouldn't concern himself with her.\nAnd indeed, over the years, Trevor had never actively inquired about Celeste's work at the company.\nEven when he encountered her at work, he treated her like she was a complete stranger.\nWhen Celeste was set to be promoted a couple of years ago, the team had hesitated. Everyone was aware of Trevor's dislike for her. They had even brought it up with him to gauge his opinion back then.\nTrevor had frowned in annoyance and reiterated that he wouldn't interfere and that they should handle it according to company policy. He had emphasized that they shouldn't bring up Celeste's matters with him again.\nSeeing Zeke's hesitation, Trevor frowned. \"What is it?\"\nZeke snapped out of his thoughts and quickly replied, \"Oh, it's nothing.\"\nSince Trevor was already aware of Celeste's resignation but hadn't brought it up, it was clear that this matter wasn't important to him. So, Zeke decided to proceed as usual and handle the matter according to company regulations.\nWith that resolved, Trevor ended the call.\n\u2026\n\"What are you thinking about?\" At noon, a colleague patted Celeste on the shoulder.\nCeleste came back to her senses and smiled, shaking her head. \"Nothing.\"\n\"Don't you need to call your daughter today?\"\n\"No, not today.\"\nTypically, she called Jordyn twice a day\u2014once at 1:00 am and once at around 12:00 pm.\nHer colleagues at work were aware of this habit. What they didn't know was her daughter was the child she had with the company's CEO.\nAfter work, Celeste went to the supermarket. She bought some groceries and a few potted plants before heading home.\nAfter dinner, she browsed online for information about the upcoming technology exhibition. \nAfter that, she made a call. \"Please reserve a ticket for next month's tech exhibition for me.\"\n\"Are you sure?\" the person on the other end replied coolly. \"The last two times you asked me to reserve tickets, you didn't show up. Do you know how many people's lifelong dream is to get one of those tickets? You wasted them thoughtlessly.\"\nThe annual tech exhibition was a major event in the industry, and tickets were not easily obtainable.\nTheir company had a limited number of slots, and many IT elites working for them eagerly vied for the opportunity to attend it.\n\"If I don't show up to the exhibition this time, I will never ask you to reserve a ticket for me ever again,\" Celeste promised.\nThere was silence on the other end before the line disconnected. \nCeleste knew that he'd agreed. The corners of her mouth tugged upward into a smile. What she hadn't said was that she wanted to return to the company.\nThough she was one of the partners of her tech firm, she had stepped back during its early days to focus on marriage and family. Her decision had disrupted their development plans and cost them many opportunities.\nHer colleagues had been both angry and frustrated with her. Over the years, they had rarely been in contact.\nWhile Celeste was eager to return, she knew she had been out of the industry for too long. If she went back unprepared, she was worried she wouldn't be able to keep up with the company's current pace.\nSo, she planned to spend some time familiarizing herself with the industry's latest developments before making a concrete decision.\nFor the next few days, Celeste focused on her work during office hours and spent her evenings tending to her own matters. She didn't reach out to Jordyn or Trevor, and they didn't contact her either.\nCeleste wasn't surprised. For over half a year, her communication with them had been one-sided. They had only passively responded to her efforts.\n\u2026\nMeanwhile, in Andostan, Jordyn had developed the habit of calling Wynn first thing every morning.\nThat day, she called Wynn right after waking up as usual. However, the call didn't last long before she burst into tears.\nWynn had told her some bad news. \"I'm going back to the country soon.\"\nDevastated, Jordyn finished the call and immediately phoned Trevor. \"Dad, did you know about this?\"\nAt his office, Trevor flipped through some documents. \"Yes.\"\n\"When did you find out?\"\n\"It's been a while.\"\n\"Dad, you're so mean\u2026\" Jordyn hugged her pink stuffed pig and cried loudly. \"I don't want Wynn to leave. If she's not here, I don't want to go to school here anymore. I want to go back too!\"\nTrevor's tone remained even. \"It's already being arranged.\"\nJordyn didn't understand. \"W-What do you mean?\"\n\"We're going back next week.\"\nJordyn jumped out of bed in excitement. \"Really?\"\n\"Yes, really,\" Trevor replied.\n\"Then why didn't Wynn tell me just now?\"\n\"It was just finalized. She doesn't know yet.\"\nJordyn was ecstatic. \"Dad, let's keep this a secret from Wynn. We'll surprise her when we go back to the country, okay?\"\n\"Alright.\"\n\"You're the best, Dad! I love you so much!\"\nAfter hanging up, Jordyn was still overjoyed. She sang and danced on her bed.\nAfter a while, she suddenly thought of Celeste. For the past few days, she had been in a great mood because Celeste hadn't called her. In fact, to avoid talking to Celeste, she had deliberately left home early and even turned off her phone or kept it far away from her after school.\nBut after two days, she was worried that Celeste might get angry if she found out. So, she stopped doing that. To her surprise, Celeste hadn't called at all in the days that followed.\nAt first, she thought Celeste had discovered that she was deliberately avoiding her calls. But then she remembered that based on past experiences, that wasn't very likely. If Celeste knew she had done something wrong, she would immediately ask Jordyn to correct her wrongdoing instead of sulking and not calling.\nAfter all, she was the most important person to Celeste. Jordyn knew that Celeste loved her the most, so she didn't think that Celeste would purposely refrain from calling her simply because she was upset.\nAs Jordyn thought about this, she suddenly missed Celeste. It was the first time in days she had thought about Celeste, and she couldn't resist dialing Celeste's number.\nBut just as the call connected, she remembered that while she would get to see Wynn after returning to the country, Celeste would undoubtedly try every possible way to prevent her from meeting Wynn. She wouldn't be able to see Wynn whenever she wanted like she could now.\nThis thought dampened Jordyn's mood.\nIt was midnight in Celeste's time zone. She was already asleep when she was woken by the call. Upon seeing Jordyn's name on the screen, she was about to answer when the call abruptly disconnected.\nAlthough Celeste had written in her divorce agreement that she would relinquish custody of Jordyn, she still felt a sense of responsibility as her mother. Worried that something might have happened, Celeste immediately called back.\nWhen Jordyn saw the incoming call, she turned her head away and refused to answer.\nCeleste became more concerned and quickly called the landline at the villa.\nHannah answered promptly. After hearing Celeste's concerns, she reassured her, \"Ms. Fleming should be fine. She went to bed late last night and woke up late today. When I checked earlier, she was still asleep. I'll go upstairs to take a look and call you back.\"\nFeeling relieved, Celeste replied, \"Thank you.\"\nWhen Hannah went upstairs, Jordyn was already in the bathroom brushing her teeth.\nAfter Hannah relayed Celeste being worried about her, Jordyn lowered her head and lied, \"I accidentally hit the call button.\"\nHannah believed her and didn't doubt what she said. Seeing that Jordyn was still brushing her teeth, she went back downstairs to update Celeste that Jordyn was fine.\nJordyn watched as Hannah left. She huffed and finally felt a bit better.\nAfter hearing Hannah's reassurance, Celeste felt relieved too. Still, having been abruptly woken, she struggled to fall back asleep. She wasn't in great shape the next morning at work.\nThe envelope containing the divorce agreement was completely forgotten by Trevor after the phone call with Wynn.\nOn the day they returned to the country, Trevor packed the last document into his briefcase and ensured that nothing was left behind before heading downstairs.\n\"All set. Let's go.\"\nThe Lincoln stretch limousine departed from the villa and headed to the airport.\n\u2026\nThat night, at around 10:00 pm, the plane carrying Trevor and Jordyn landed on time. By the time they got home, it was nearly midnight. \nJordyn had fallen asleep before they arrived. When Trevor carried her upstairs, he passed the master bedroom and noticed the door was open, but the room was pitch black.\nAfter putting Jordyn on her bed and tucking her in, he returned to the master bedroom and turned on the light. Then, he glanced at the bed and found that it was empty\u2014Celeste wasn't there.\nJust then, the butler, Peter Hawk, came upstairs with his luggage. \nLoosening his tie, Trevor asked, \"Where is she?\"\nPeter replied, \"Mrs. Fleming is on a business trip.\"\nHalf a month ago, Peter hadn't been around when Celeste had left with her suitcase. The other maids told him that Celeste left with a suitcase, so he had assumed she was traveling for work.\nNow that he thought about it, this was unusual. Celeste rarely went on business trips. Even when she did, they typically lasted only two or three days.\nThis time, she had been gone for over two weeks.\n\"Alright,\" Trevor responded indifferently, asking no further questions.\n...\nThe next day, Celeste unexpectedly ran into Trevor at the company. She hadn't known that Trevor and Jordyn had returned to the country. Caught off guard by their sudden encounter, Celeste froze mid-step.\nTrevor also seemed slightly surprised to see her, but he assumed she had just returned from the business trip and didn't think much of it.\nHe passed by her coldly, his face expressionless. As usual, he treated her like she was a stranger and turned to enter the building.\nIn the past, if Celeste had found out that he'd suddenly come back, she would have been overjoyed. Even if she couldn't throw herself into his arms in such a scenario, she would have been very happy and excited. Her eyes would light up as she greeted him. \nEven if Trevor remained indifferent, she would have smiled and wished him good morning enthusiastically.\nBut now, Celeste merely glanced at his handsome face before lowering her eyes. There was no longer any trace of the joy and excitement she once felt.\nTrevor didn't notice any of this and was already walking away.\nWatching his tall and composed figure disappear into the building, Celeste wondered when he had returned. Since he was back, perhaps the matter of their divorce could soon be addressed.\nHaving resolved to go through with the divorce, Celeste didn't dwell on him further. After she returned to her workstation, she quickly immersed herself in her work.\nHalf an hour later, Zeke called her and instructed her to do something. \"Prepare two cups of coffee and take them to Mr. Fleming's office.\"\nIn the early days of her marriage, Celeste had learned that Trevor enjoyed coffee. In hopes of winning his favor, she had spent a great deal of effort studying how to brew it perfectly. Her efforts had paid off. After tasting her coffee, Trevor began to specifically request it, both at home and at the office.\nWhen she first realized he genuinely liked the coffee she made, Celeste had been thrilled. She naively believed it was the first step toward gaining his approval.\nBut she had underestimated his dislike and wariness of her. While he liked her coffee, that was all he liked. His attitude toward her remained cold and distant.\nEven when he wanted her coffee, he would have Zeke reach out to her. Once the coffee was prepared, someone else would pick it up for him. He never gave her the opportunity to approach him herself.\nOnly on rare occasions when no one else was available did she get the chance to deliver it to his office personally.\nThis time, it seemed she was to take the coffee directly to Trevor herself from Zeke's tone. After brewing the coffee, Celeste placed the cups on a tray and carried them to his office.\nThe door to his office was ajar.\nAs she approached and was about to knock on the door politely, she saw Wynn sitting on Trevor's lap. The two of them seemed to be locked in a passionate kiss.\nCeleste stopped in her tracks, her face turning pale.\nUpon seeing her, Wynn shot up from Trevor's lap, looking flustered.\nTrevor's expression darkened, and he questioned in an icy tone, \"Who allowed you to come in?\"\n..."

                  "text": "Every time my husband filed for divorce, he had only one condition: I took all the property, and he only wanted our daughter.\nOn my birthday, I flew across the ocean to surprise them\u2026 and found him having dinner with his true love\u2014my stepsister.\nMy daughter looked at her and said, \u201cMommy.\u201d\nThat day, I finally woke up.\nI drafted the divorce papers, gave up custody, and walked away from it all, building a billion-dollar empire from scratch.\nBut when I returned home one night with a business partner, my ex husband cornered me against the wall.\n\u201cDivorce?\u201d he said, eyes dark. \u201cNot a chance.\u201d\n\nAfter seven years of marriage, my husband, Trevor, fell for another woman\u2014even our daughter wanted her as her new mom.\nI scoffed at the years I\u2019d wasted and handed him the divorce papers. Yet he dropped his usual aloofness, slamming me against the wall,\n\u201cDivorce? Not a chance.\u201d\n***\nWhen Celeste Rodriguez landed at the airport in Andostan, it was already past 9:00 pm.\nIt was her birthday. Her phone buzzed with messages from colleagues and friends\u2014but not a single one from her husband, Trevor Fleming.\nCeleste's smile faded.\nBy the time she reached the villa, it was already past 10:00 pm.\nHannah Lynd, the housekeeper looked startled. \"Mrs. Fleming... what a surprise.\"\n\"Where are Trevor and Jo?\" Celeste asked, handing over her luggage.\n\"Mr. Fleming isn\u2019t back yet. Miss Jordyn\u2019s upstairs playing.\"\nCeleste climbed the stairs. In her room, Jordyn sat in pajamas at her desk, completely absorbed.\n\"Jo?\" Celeste called.\nJordyn turned, her eyes lighting up. In a happy tone, she greeted, \"Mom!\"\nBut then she quickly got back to what she was doing earlier.\nCeleste walked over and hugged her tight, planting a kiss on her cheek. Yet the little one pushed her away and squirmed. \"Mom, I\u2019m busy.\" \nIt had been two months since Celeste last saw Jordyn. She missed her so much that no amount of kisses felt enough. She wanted to talk to Jordyn.\nShe noticed the necklace Jordyn was threading. \"Jo, are you making a seashell necklace?\"\n\"Mm-hm!\" Jordyn perked up visibly. \"Wynn's birthday is in a week. Dad and I picked and polished these ourselves. Pretty, right?\"\nCeleste\u2019s throat tightened. Jordyn didn\u2019t look up, only added brightly, \"Dad even got her a custom gift, tomorrow\u2014\"\nCeleste felt a pang in her chest and couldn't hold back anymore. \"Jo\u2026 Do you remember it's my birthday today?\"\n\"Huh?\" Jordyn glanced up briefly, then quickly looked back down at the string of beads in her hands, She complained, \"Mom, don\u2019t talk, Look, I messed up the bead order\u2014\"\nCeleste stood there in silence for a while, but Jordyn never looked back up. Finally, Celeste pursed her lips and left the room without another word.\nDownstairs, Hannah said, \"I called Mr. Fleming. He said he\u2019s busy tonight and you should rest first.\"\n\"I see.\" Celeste replied softly.\nShe hesitated, then called Trevor. It rang for a while before he answered.\nhis tone was indifferent as usual. \"I'm busy. Let's talk tomorrow\u2014\"\nA woman\u2019s voice chimed in: \"Trevor, who is it?\"\nWynn.\nCeleste gripped the phone tighter.\n\"No one important,\" Trevor answered her.\nBefore Celeste could say anything, Trevor had already hung up.\nCeleste stared at the screen. Two or three months apart, and this was all he had for her.\nAfter so many years of marriage, he\u2019d always been cold. Distant. Impatient. \nShe had got used to chasing after him, calling again, begging for time. Yet tonight, she didn\u2019t bother. \nPerhaps she was just too tired.\n\nThe next morning, Celeste thought it over and decided to call Trevor again.\nThere was a time difference of about 17 or 18 hours between Andostan and their home country. In Andostan, today was her actual birthday.\nShe didn\u2019t just come here for Jordyn. She wanted one thing: a family meal. Her only birthday wish.\nYet, Trevor didn\u2019t answer.\nA long time later, he texted: What\u2019s up?\nShe replied: Lunch today? Just the three of us.\nTrevor answered: Okay. Send the address.\nAlright, she typed back.\nThat was it. No acknowledgment. No \u201cHappy birthday.\u201d She wasn\u2019t surprised. But it still stung.\nAs she headed downstairs, she overheard Jordyn talking with Hannah.\n\"Aren't you happy that Mrs. Fleming is here, sweetie?\" Hannah asked.\n\"Dad and I promised to take Wynn to the beach tomorrow. If Mom comes, it'll be weird. She\u2019s always mean to Wynn.\"\n\"Mrs. Fleming is still your mom, sweetie. That\u2019s hurtful.\"\n\"I know, but Dad and I like Wynn more. Can't Wynn be my mom instead?\"\nCeleste froze.\nShe had raised Jordyn herself most of the time. But over the past two years, the more time Jordyn spent with Trevor, the more attached she became to him. When Trevor came to Andostan to expand his business last year, Jordyn had insisted on coming along.\nCeleste was reluctant and had hoped Jordyn would stay by her side. But she couldn't bear to see Jordyn upset, so she agreed.\nAnd now, Jordyn didn\u2019t even want her as her mom anymore.\nCeleste stood frozen in place, her face pale. To think that she had pushed aside her work to come to Andostan with the intention of spending more time with Jordyn.\nNow, it seemed unnecessary.\nShe walked back to her room, pale and quiet, then repacked the gifts she\u2019d brought.\nLater, Hannah texted: Madame, I took Jordyn out. Let me know if you need anything.\nCeleste sat on the bed, feeling hollow and lost inside. She had abandoned her work and made this trip, only to find no one wanted her here.\nHer arrival was nothing but a joke.\n\nAfter a long while, she left the villa. Aimlessly, she drove around in this foreign yet familiar country.\nBy noon, she remembered she had planned to have lunch with Trevor and Jordyn. As she recalled what she had overheard in the morning, she hesitated about whether to go home and pick up Jordyn. \nThen, a text from Trevor came: Something came up. Lunch\u2019s canceled.\nCeleste stared at it.\nShe should\u2019ve known. Trevor always canceled on her.  His work, friends, and everything else always came before her, his wife.\nOnce, she\u2019d cry. Today, she just felt\u2026 empty.\nCeleste was at an utter loss. She had come all this way excitedly only to be met with indifference from both Trevor and Jordyn.\nAimlessly, she drove around. Eventually, she found herself outside an old favorite restaurant which she and Trevor used to frequent.\nJust as she was about to walk in, she saw them.\nTrevor. Jordyn. Wynn.\nWynn sat next to Jordyn, laughing, feeding the little one the pastries she had taken a bite out of. Jordyn giggled, with her legs swinging around happily. Trevor smiled as he served food to both of them, but his gaze never left Wynn.\nWhat a happy family of three!\nSo this was his \"something came up.\"\nAnd this was the daughter she had carried for ten long months and nearly lost her life to bring into this world.\nCeleste laughed humorlessly. She stood there watching for a long time. Finally, she turned and drove away.\n\nBack at the villa, Celeste drafted the divorce agreement.\nTrevor had been her teenage dream\u2014but he had never truly seen her. If not for that one night and his grandfather Arnold Fleming\u2019s pressure, he never would\u2019ve married her. She thought loving him hard enough would be enough, but seven years proved otherwise.\nFor a long time, she felt lucky to have Jo\u2014her only source of comfort. But now, even Jo didn\u2019t seem to want her.\nThat was it.\nShe was done\u2014with the marriage, the lies, the thankless role of wife and mother. It was time to leave all this behind\u2014and reclaim the promising life she'd given up!\nShe sealed the divorce papers, handed them to Hannah, then grabbed her suitcase and walked out, bound for the airport. On the way, she finally dialed the number she\u2019d been avoiding for months.\nThe line rang once. Twice. A click.\n\u201cHello?\u201d\nShe took a breath, steady and sharp.\u201cThat offer still stand?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d\n...\nAt around 9:00 pm, Trevor and Jordyn returned home.\nJordyn clung to the hem of Trevor's coat and got out of the car sluggishly. Because Celeste was at home, she was reluctant to return that night.\nBut Wynn had said that Celeste came specifically to be with her and Trevor, and if they didn't return, she would be sad. Trevor also said that if they didn't go home that night, Celeste would definitely insist on joining them on their outing to the sea the next day.\nReluctantly, Jordyn agreed to come home.\nStill worried, she muttered gloomily, \"Dad, what if Mom insists on tagging along with us tomorrow?\"\n\"She won't,\" Trevor replied confidently.\nIn all the years they'd been married, Celeste had always tried to find ways to spend more time with him. But she was also sensible. As long as he made his stance clear, she wouldn't dare make him upset.\nIn Jordyn's memory, Celeste always listened to Trevor. Since he said she wouldn't, she felt reassured. As a result, her mood lifted. She made her way into the villa cheerfully and told Hannah she wanted to take a bath.\n\"Sure, sure,\" Hannah replied to Jordyn. Then, she remembered Celeste's instructions and handed an envelope to Trevor. \"Mr. Fleming, this is from Mrs. Fleming. She asked me to give it to you.\"\nTrevor took the envelope and asked casually, \"Where is she?\"\n\"Mrs. Fleming packed up and went back to the country this afternoon. Didn't you know?\" Hannah responded.\nTrevor paused mid-step as he was heading upstairs. He turned back, feeling a little surprised. \"Has she gone back?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nWhy had Celeste suddenly come to Andostan? Trevor hadn't given her a chance to tell him about it. He hadn't cared to ask either. Upon learning she'd left, he didn't dwell on it.\nJordyn was a little surprised too. When she heard the news, she felt a small twinge of disappointment. She'd been thinking that even if Celeste didn't join them for the outing tomorrow, it might be nice to have her around at home in the evening.\nPolishing the seashells made her hands hurt\u2014she had been counting on Celeste's help in finishing the necklace.\nThough it had been months since Trevor and Celeste had seen each other, she had made the effort to visit but only to leave without seeing him in person. Hannah recalled Celeste's grim expression as she left and thought that things felt a little off.\nShe couldn't help but say, \"Mr. Fleming, Mrs. Fleming looked upset when she left. She seemed angry.\"\nHannah had assumed Celeste's sudden departure was due to an urgent matter. Upon realizing Trevor hadn't known she'd left, she began to feel something was amiss.\n\"Angry?\" Trevor repeated in his mind. \nIn his presence, Celeste had always been patient and accommodating. So, she could get angry too? This was new.\nTrevor smiled faintly and responded to Hannah perfunctorily before heading upstairs.\nBack in the bedroom, he was about to open the envelope Celeste had left when Wynn called. After answering the call, he tossed the envelope aside and walked out the door.\nA short while later, the envelope slipped off the bed onto the floor.\nThat night, Trevor didn't return home.\nThe next day, Hannah noticed the envelope on the floor when she was cleaning. Recognizing it as the one Celeste had asked her to hand over, she assumed Trevor had already seen it and placed it in a nearby drawer.\n\u2026\nRight after getting off the plane, Celeste went home and began packing her belongings. She had accumulated quite a few things in the house since she'd been living there for six years, after all. But she only took a few sets of clothes, two sets of daily necessities, and some books that were related to her field of study back in college.\nAfter their marriage, Trevor had been depositing money for her and Jordyn into two separate accounts every month. One account was hers, and the other was Jordyn's.\nHowever, Celeste was used to spending her own money only. She had never touched the money in Jordyn's account. Because she loved Trevor, whenever she went shopping and saw clothes, shoes, cufflinks, or ties that suited him, she couldn't help but buy them.\nIn contrast, she didn't have many expenses on a daily basis because all she did was go to work. Her heart and mind were always focused on Trevor and Jordyn. She wanted to give them the best of everything.\nMost of the money Trevor deposited into her bank account was spent on him and Jordyn.\nGiven this spending pattern, there shouldn't have been much money left in Celeste's account. But over the past year, her opportunities to buy things for Trevor and Jordyn had decreased significantly because they were in Andostan.\nNow, there were over three million dollars in her account. That amount might not matter to Trevor, but to her, it was no small sum. And since it was her money, Celeste didn't hesitate to transfer it out.\nShe left both cards behind, dragged her suitcase out the door, and didn't look back.\nCeleste had an apartment near her workplace, which was a little over 1,100 square feet. She'd bought it four years ago to support a friend who had been struggling to meet their sales targets. She had never lived there before.\nNow, the apartment came in handy. She had it cleaned regularly, so it wasn't dirty. After a quick tidy-up, it was ready to move in.\nAfter a long day, Celeste washed up and went to bed around 10:00 pm.\n\u2026\nThe shrill sound of an alarm jolted Celeste awake. Startled, her mind went blank for a moment.\nWhen she came to her senses, she realized that while it was 1:00 am here, it was 7:00 am in Andostan, where Trevor and Jordyn were. This was their usual breakfast time.\nEver since Jordyn had gone to live with Trevor in Andostan, Celeste had developed the habit of calling her at this time every day. As she was always exhausted from work and was used to going to bed early, she had set this alarm to ensure she wouldn't miss the call.\nAt first, Jordyn hadn't adapted well to living in Andostan and had missed her terribly. She had called Celeste constantly. But as time went on, the calls that used to be full of yearning and dependence had grown perfunctory and impatient.\nThe alarm was no longer necessary. She just hadn't been able to let go.\nSmiling bitterly, Celeste deleted the alarm and turned off her phone before going back to sleep.\n\u2026\nMeanwhile, Trevor and Jordyn were nearly done with breakfast. Though he knew Celeste usually called Jordyn at this time, he wasn't always home and hadn't paid much attention to the routine.\nHe noticed that Celeste hadn't called that day. The fact registered in his mind, but he didn't care. After finishing breakfast, he went upstairs to change.\nJordyn, finding Celeste increasingly annoying, had grown less fond of their calls. Upon realizing that Celeste hadn't called yet, she figured something must have come up.\nShe grabbed her backpack and bolted for the door.\nHannah hurried after her. \"Ms. Fleming, it's still early. There's no rush!\"\nJordyn ignored her and ran to the car happily. She was thrilled that Celeste hadn't called on time that day. If she stayed home, she might still have to talk to Celeste later. Well, she didn't want that!\n\u2026\nAfter getting married to Trevor, Celeste had joined Fleming Group for his sake. Now that she was planning to divorce him, she saw no reason to stay.\nThe next morning, Celeste handed her resignation letter to Zeke Jackson after arriving at the office.\nZeke was one of Trevor's personal secretaries. When he saw Celeste's resignation letter, he was extremely surprised.\nHe was one of the few in the company who knew about the relationship between Celeste and Trevor.\nAnyone familiar with Trevor knew that he didn't love Celeste. So, he had been cold to her and rarely went home after their marriage.\nTo get closer to and win over Trevor, Celeste had chosen to work at Fleming Group.\nHer initial goal was to become his personal secretary, but Trevor refused vehemently. Even when Arnold stepped in, he couldn't get Trevor to agree. In the end, Celeste had to settle for a position in the secretarial team, becoming one of Trevor's many ordinary secretaries.\nAt first, Zeke had worried that Celeste's presence in the secretarial team would create chaos. But to his surprise, she didn't bring them any trouble. Although Celeste used her position to get closer to Trevor, she was mindful of her timing and never overstepped her boundaries. \nOn the contrary, she worked diligently and performed exceptionally well, hoping to gain Trevor's respect. Whether during her pregnancy, childbirth, or any other time, she strictly adhered to company policies and never sought special treatment.\nOver the years, Celeste rose to become the head of the secretarial team. Zeke had observed her feelings for Trevor from the sidelines all the while. To be honest, he had never imagined she would resign one day. He felt skeptical about her willingly giving up her position.\nSomething must have happened between Celeste and Trevor for her to resign now. Zeke understood that this was something he wasn't privy to\u2014it must be something significant enough for Trevor to have ordered her to resign.\nWhile he found it a pity, Zeke maintained a professional tone. \"I acknowledge that I've received your resignation letter. I'll arrange for someone to take over your duties as soon as possible.\"\n\"Alright.\" Celeste nodded and returned to her workstation.\nAfter working for a while, Zeke started an online meeting with Trevor to report on company matters. As the conversation neared its end, he suddenly remembered Celeste's resignation. \n\"Oh, Mr. Fleming, there's one more thing\u2014\"\nAlthough Zeke had told Celeste he would quickly arrange for someone to take over her position, he wanted to gauge Trevor's thoughts on the matter first. If Trevor wanted Celeste out immediately, he would make the arrangements right away.\nBut as the words left his mouth, he remembered that when Celeste first joined the company, Trevor had explicitly stated that all matters regarding her employment should be handled per company regulations. He made it clear that there was no need to report anything to him since he wouldn't concern himself with her.\nAnd indeed, over the years, Trevor had never actively inquired about Celeste's work at the company.\nEven when he encountered her at work, he treated her like she was a complete stranger.\nWhen Celeste was set to be promoted a couple of years ago, the team had hesitated. Everyone was aware of Trevor's dislike for her. They had even brought it up with him to gauge his opinion back then.\nTrevor had frowned in annoyance and reiterated that he wouldn't interfere and that they should handle it according to company policy. He had emphasized that they shouldn't bring up Celeste's matters with him again.\nSeeing Zeke's hesitation, Trevor frowned. \"What is it?\"\nZeke snapped out of his thoughts and quickly replied, \"Oh, it's nothing.\"\nSince Trevor was already aware of Celeste's resignation but hadn't brought it up, it was clear that this matter wasn't important to him. So, Zeke decided to proceed as usual and handle the matter according to company regulations.\nWith that resolved, Trevor ended the call.\n\u2026\n\"What are you thinking about?\" At noon, a colleague patted Celeste on the shoulder.\nCeleste came back to her senses and smiled, shaking her head. \"Nothing.\"\n\"Don't you need to call your daughter today?\"\n\"No, not today.\"\nTypically, she called Jordyn twice a day\u2014once at 1:00 am and once at around 12:00 pm.\nHer colleagues at work were aware of this habit. What they didn't know was her daughter was the child she had with the company's CEO.\nAfter work, Celeste went to the supermarket. She bought some groceries and a few potted plants before heading home.\nAfter dinner, she browsed online for information about the upcoming technology exhibition. \nAfter that, she made a call. \"Please reserve a ticket for next month's tech exhibition for me.\"\n\"Are you sure?\" the person on the other end replied coolly. \"The last two times you asked me to reserve tickets, you didn't show up. Do you know how many people's lifelong dream is to get one of those tickets? You wasted them thoughtlessly.\"\nThe annual tech exhibition was a major event in the industry, and tickets were not easily obtainable.\nTheir company had a limited number of slots, and many IT elites working for them eagerly vied for the opportunity to attend it.\n\"If I don't show up to the exhibition this time, I will never ask you to reserve a ticket for me ever again,\" Celeste promised.\nThere was silence on the other end before the line disconnected. \nCeleste knew that he'd agreed. The corners of her mouth tugged upward into a smile. What she hadn't said was that she wanted to return to the company.\nThough she was one of the partners of her tech firm, she had stepped back during its early days to focus on marriage and family. Her decision had disrupted their development plans and cost them many opportunities.\nHer colleagues had been both angry and frustrated with her. Over the years, they had rarely been in contact.\nWhile Celeste was eager to return, she knew she had been out of the industry for too long. If she went back unprepared, she was worried she wouldn't be able to keep up with the company's current pace.\nSo, she planned to spend some time familiarizing herself with the industry's latest developments before making a concrete decision.\nFor the next few days, Celeste focused on her work during office hours and spent her evenings tending to her own matters. She didn't reach out to Jordyn or Trevor, and they didn't contact her either.\nCeleste wasn't surprised. For over half a year, her communication with them had been one-sided. They had only passively responded to her efforts.\n\u2026\nMeanwhile, in Andostan, Jordyn had developed the habit of calling Wynn first thing every morning.\nThat day, she called Wynn right after waking up as usual. However, the call didn't last long before she burst into tears.\nWynn had told her some bad news. \"I'm going back to the country soon.\"\nDevastated, Jordyn finished the call and immediately phoned Trevor. \"Dad, did you know about this?\"\nAt his office, Trevor flipped through some documents. \"Yes.\"\n\"When did you find out?\"\n\"It's been a while.\"\n\"Dad, you're so mean\u2026\" Jordyn hugged her pink stuffed pig and cried loudly. \"I don't want Wynn to leave. If she's not here, I don't want to go to school here anymore. I want to go back too!\"\nTrevor's tone remained even. \"It's already being arranged.\"\nJordyn didn't understand. \"W-What do you mean?\"\n\"We're going back next week.\"\nJordyn jumped out of bed in excitement. \"Really?\"\n\"Yes, really,\" Trevor replied.\n\"Then why didn't Wynn tell me just now?\"\n\"It was just finalized. She doesn't know yet.\"\nJordyn was ecstatic. \"Dad, let's keep this a secret from Wynn. We'll surprise her when we go back to the country, okay?\"\n\"Alright.\"\n\"You're the best, Dad! I love you so much!\"\nAfter hanging up, Jordyn was still overjoyed. She sang and danced on her bed.\nAfter a while, she suddenly thought of Celeste. For the past few days, she had been in a great mood because Celeste hadn't called her. In fact, to avoid talking to Celeste, she had deliberately left home early and even turned off her phone or kept it far away from her after school.\nBut after two days, she was worried that Celeste might get angry if she found out. So, she stopped doing that. To her surprise, Celeste hadn't called at all in the days that followed.\nAt first, she thought Celeste had discovered that she was deliberately avoiding her calls. But then she remembered that based on past experiences, that wasn't very likely. If Celeste knew she had done something wrong, she would immediately ask Jordyn to correct her wrongdoing instead of sulking and not calling.\nAfter all, she was the most important person to Celeste. Jordyn knew that Celeste loved her the most, so she didn't think that Celeste would purposely refrain from calling her simply because she was upset.\nAs Jordyn thought about this, she suddenly missed Celeste. It was the first time in days she had thought about Celeste, and she couldn't resist dialing Celeste's number.\nBut just as the call connected, she remembered that while she would get to see Wynn after returning to the country, Celeste would undoubtedly try every possible way to prevent her from meeting Wynn. She wouldn't be able to see Wynn whenever she wanted like she could now.\nThis thought dampened Jordyn's mood.\nIt was midnight in Celeste's time zone. She was already asleep when she was woken by the call. Upon seeing Jordyn's name on the screen, she was about to answer when the call abruptly disconnected.\nAlthough Celeste had written in her divorce agreement that she would relinquish custody of Jordyn, she still felt a sense of responsibility as her mother. Worried that something might have happened, Celeste immediately called back.\nWhen Jordyn saw the incoming call, she turned her head away and refused to answer.\nCeleste became more concerned and quickly called the landline at the villa.\nHannah answered promptly. After hearing Celeste's concerns, she reassured her, \"Ms. Fleming should be fine. She went to bed late last night and woke up late today. When I checked earlier, she was still asleep. I'll go upstairs to take a look and call you back.\"\nFeeling relieved, Celeste replied, \"Thank you.\"\nWhen Hannah went upstairs, Jordyn was already in the bathroom brushing her teeth.\nAfter Hannah relayed Celeste being worried about her, Jordyn lowered her head and lied, \"I accidentally hit the call button.\"\nHannah believed her and didn't doubt what she said. Seeing that Jordyn was still brushing her teeth, she went back downstairs to update Celeste that Jordyn was fine.\nJordyn watched as Hannah left. She huffed and finally felt a bit better.\nAfter hearing Hannah's reassurance, Celeste felt relieved too. Still, having been abruptly woken, she struggled to fall back asleep. She wasn't in great shape the next morning at work.\nThe envelope containing the divorce agreement was completely forgotten by Trevor after the phone call with Wynn.\nOn the day they returned to the country, Trevor packed the last document into his briefcase and ensured that nothing was left behind before heading downstairs.\n\"All set. Let's go.\"\nThe Lincoln stretch limousine departed from the villa and headed to the airport.\n\u2026\nThat night, at around 10:00 pm, the plane carrying Trevor and Jordyn landed on time. By the time they got home, it was nearly midnight. \nJordyn had fallen asleep before they arrived. When Trevor carried her upstairs, he passed the master bedroom and noticed the door was open, but the room was pitch black.\nAfter putting Jordyn on her bed and tucking her in, he returned to the master bedroom and turned on the light. Then, he glanced at the bed and found that it was empty\u2014Celeste wasn't there.\nJust then, the butler, Peter Hawk, came upstairs with his luggage. \nLoosening his tie, Trevor asked, \"Where is she?\"\nPeter replied, \"Mrs. Fleming is on a business trip.\"\nHalf a month ago, Peter hadn't been around when Celeste had left with her suitcase. The other maids told him that Celeste left with a suitcase, so he had assumed she was traveling for work.\nNow that he thought about it, this was unusual. Celeste rarely went on business trips. Even when she did, they typically lasted only two or three days.\nThis time, she had been gone for over two weeks.\n\"Alright,\" Trevor responded indifferently, asking no further questions.\n...\nThe next day, Celeste unexpectedly ran into Trevor at the company. She hadn't known that Trevor and Jordyn had returned to the country. Caught off guard by their sudden encounter, Celeste froze mid-step.\nTrevor also seemed slightly surprised to see her, but he assumed she had just returned from the business trip and didn't think much of it.\nHe passed by her coldly, his face expressionless. As usual, he treated her like she was a stranger and turned to enter the building.\nIn the past, if Celeste had found out that he'd suddenly come back, she would have been overjoyed. Even if she couldn't throw herself into his arms in such a scenario, she would have been very happy and excited. Her eyes would light up as she greeted him. \nEven if Trevor remained indifferent, she would have smiled and wished him good morning enthusiastically.\nBut now, Celeste merely glanced at his handsome face before lowering her eyes. There was no longer any trace of the joy and excitement she once felt.\nTrevor didn't notice any of this and was already walking away.\nWatching his tall and composed figure disappear into the building, Celeste wondered when he had returned. Since he was back, perhaps the matter of their divorce could soon be addressed.\nHaving resolved to go through with the divorce, Celeste didn't dwell on him further. After she returned to her workstation, she quickly immersed herself in her work.\nHalf an hour later, Zeke called her and instructed her to do something. \"Prepare two cups of coffee and take them to Mr. Fleming's office.\"\nIn the early days of her marriage, Celeste had learned that Trevor enjoyed coffee. In hopes of winning his favor, she had spent a great deal of effort studying how to brew it perfectly. Her efforts had paid off. After tasting her coffee, Trevor began to specifically request it, both at home and at the office.\nWhen she first realized he genuinely liked the coffee she made, Celeste had been thrilled. She naively believed it was the first step toward gaining his approval.\nBut she had underestimated his dislike and wariness of her. While he liked her coffee, that was all he liked. His attitude toward her remained cold and distant.\nEven when he wanted her coffee, he would have Zeke reach out to her. Once the coffee was prepared, someone else would pick it up for him. He never gave her the opportunity to approach him herself.\nOnly on rare occasions when no one else was available did she get the chance to deliver it to his office personally.\nThis time, it seemed she was to take the coffee directly to Trevor herself from Zeke's tone. After brewing the coffee, Celeste placed the cups on a tray and carried them to his office.\nThe door to his office was ajar.\nAs she approached and was about to knock on the door politely, she saw Wynn sitting on Trevor's lap. The two of them seemed to be locked in a passionate kiss.\nCeleste stopped in her tracks, her face turning pale.\nUpon seeing her, Wynn shot up from Trevor's lap, looking flustered.\nTrevor's expression darkened, and he questioned in an icy tone, \"Who allowed you to come in?\"\n..."

Her phone buzzed with messages from colleagues and friends\u2014but not a single one from her husband, Trevor Fleming.\nCeleste's smile faded.\nBy the time she reached the villa, it was already past 10:00 pm.\nHannah Lynd, the housekeeper looked startled. \"Mrs. Fleming... what a surprise.\"\n\"Where are Trevor and Jo?\" Celeste asked, handing over her luggage.\n\"Mr. Fleming isn\u2019t back yet. Miss Jordyn\u2019s upstairs playing.\"\nCeleste climbed the stairs. In her room, Jordyn sat in pajamas at her desk, completely absorbed.\n\"Jo?\" Celeste called.\nJordyn turned, her eyes lighting up. In a happy tone, she greeted, \"Mom!\"\nBut then she quickly got back to what she was doing earlier.\nCeleste walked over and hugged her tight, planting a kiss on her cheek. Yet the little one pushed her away and squirmed. \"Mom, I\u2019m busy.\" \nIt had been two months since Celeste last saw Jordyn. She missed her so much that no amount of kisses felt enough. She wanted to talk to Jordyn.\nShe noticed the necklace Jordyn was threading. \"Jo, are you making a seashell necklace?\"\n\"Mm-hm!\" Jordyn perked up visibly. \"Wynn's birthday is in a week. Dad and I picked and polished these ourselves. Pretty, right?\"\nCeleste\u2019s throat tightened. Jordyn didn\u2019t look up, only added brightly, \"Dad even got her a custom gift, tomorrow\u2014\"\nCeleste felt a pang in her chest and couldn't hold back anymore. \"Jo\u2026 Do you remember it's my birthday today?\"\n\"Huh?\" Jordyn glanced up briefly, then quickly looked back down at the string of beads in her hands, She complained, \"Mom, don\u2019t talk, Look, I messed up the bead order\u2014\"\nCeleste stood there in silence for a while, but Jordyn never looked back up. Finally, Celeste pursed her lips and left the room without another word.\nDownstairs, Hannah said, \"I called Mr. Fleming. He said he\u2019s busy tonight and you should rest first.\"\n\"I see.\" Celeste replied softly.\nShe hesitated, then called Trevor. It rang for a while before he answered.\nhis tone was indifferent as usual. \"I'm busy. Let's talk tomorrow\u2014\"\nA woman\u2019s voice chimed in: \"Trevor, who is it?\"\nWynn.\nCeleste gripped the phone tighter.\n\"No one important,\" Trevor answered her.\nBefore Celeste could say anything, Trevor had already hung up.\nCeleste stared at the screen. Two or three months apart, and this was all he had for her.\nAfter so many years of marriage, he\u2019d always been cold. Distant. Impatient. \nShe had got used to chasing after him, calling again, begging for time. Yet tonight, she didn\u2019t bother. \nPerhaps she was just too tired.\n\nThe next morning, Celeste thought it over and decided to call Trevor again.\nThere was a time difference of about 17 or 18 hours between Andostan and their home country. In Andostan, today was her actual birthday.\nShe didn\u2019t just come here for Jordyn. She wanted one thing: a family meal. Her only birthday wish.\nYet, Trevor didn\u2019t answer.\nA long time later, he texted: What\u2019s up?\nShe replied: Lunch today? Just the three of us.\nTrevor answered: Okay. Send the address.\nAlright, she typed back.\nThat was it. No acknowledgment. No \u201cHappy birthday.\u201d She wasn\u2019t surprised. But it still stung.\nAs she headed downstairs, she overheard Jordyn talking with Hannah.\n\"Aren't you happy that Mrs. Fleming is here, sweetie?\" Hannah asked.\n\"Dad and I promised to take Wynn to the beach tomorrow. If Mom comes, it'll be weird. She\u2019s always mean to Wynn.\"\n\"Mrs. Fleming is still your mom, sweetie. That\u2019s hurtful.\"\n\"I know, but Dad and I like Wynn more. Can't Wynn be my mom instead?\"\nCeleste froze.\nShe had raised Jordyn herself most of the time. But over the past two years, the more time Jordyn spent with Trevor, the more attached she became to him. When Trevor came to Andostan to expand his business last year, Jordyn had insisted on coming along.\nCeleste was reluctant and had hoped Jordyn would stay by her side. But she couldn't bear to see Jordyn upset, so she agreed.\nAnd now, Jordyn didn\u2019t even want her as her mom anymore.\nCeleste stood frozen in place, her face pale. To think that she had pushed aside her work to come to Andostan with the intention of spending more time with Jordyn.\nNow, it seemed unnecessary.\nShe walked back to her room, pale and quiet, then repacked the gifts she\u2019d brought.\nLater, Hannah texted: Madame, I took Jordyn out. Let me know if you need anything.\nCeleste sat on the bed, feeling hollow and lost inside. She had abandoned her work and made this trip, only to find no one wanted her here.\nHer arrival was nothing but a joke.\n\nAfter a long while, she left the villa. Aimlessly, she drove around in this foreign yet familiar country.\nBy noon, she remembered she had planned to have lunch with Trevor and Jordyn. As she recalled what she had overheard in the morning, she hesitated about whether to go home and pick up Jordyn. \nThen, a text from Trevor came: Something came up. Lunch\u2019s canceled.\nCeleste stared at it.\nShe should\u2019ve known. Trevor always canceled on her.  His work, friends, and everything else always came before her, his wife.\nOnce, she\u2019d cry. Today, she just felt\u2026 empty.\nCeleste was at an utter loss. She had come all this way excitedly only to be met with indifference from both Trevor and Jordyn.\nAimlessly, she drove around. Eventually, she found herself outside an old favorite restaurant which she and Trevor used to frequent.\nJust as she was about to walk in, she saw them.\nTrevor. Jordyn. Wynn.\nWynn sat next to Jordyn, laughing, feeding the little one the pastries she had taken a bite out of. Jordyn giggled, with her legs swinging around happily. Trevor smiled as he served food to both of them, but his gaze never left Wynn.\nWhat a happy family of three!\nSo this was his \"something came up.\"\nAnd this was the daughter she had carried for ten long months and nearly lost her life to bring into this world.\nCeleste laughed humorlessly. She stood there watching for a long time. Finally, she turned and drove away.\n\nBack at the villa, Celeste drafted the divorce agreement.\nTrevor had been her teenage dream\u2014but he had never truly seen her. If not for that one night and his grandfather Arnold Fleming\u2019s pressure, he never would\u2019ve married her. She thought loving him hard enough would be enough, but seven years proved otherwise.\nFor a long time, she felt lucky to have Jo\u2014her only source of comfort. But now, even Jo didn\u2019t seem to want her.\nThat was it.\nShe was done\u2014with the marriage, the lies, the thankless role of wife and mother. It was time to leave all this behind\u2014and reclaim the promising life she'd given up!\nShe sealed the divorce papers, handed them to Hannah, then grabbed her suitcase and walked out, bound for the airport. On the way, she finally dialed the number she\u2019d been avoiding for months.\nThe line rang once. Twice. A click.\n\u201cHello?\u201d\nShe took a breath, steady and sharp.\u201cThat offer still stand?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d\n...\nAt around 9:00 pm, Trevor and Jordyn returned home.\nJordyn clung to the hem of Trevor's coat and got out of the car sluggishly. Because Celeste was at home, she was reluctant to return that night.\nBut Wynn had said that Celeste came specifically to be with her and Trevor, and if they didn't return, she would be sad. Trevor also said that if they didn't go home that night, Celeste would definitely insist on joining them on their outing to the sea the next day.\nReluctantly, Jordyn agreed to come home.\nStill worried, she muttered gloomily, \"Dad, what if Mom insists on tagging along with us tomorrow?\"\n\"She won't,\" Trevor replied confidently.\nIn all the years they'd been married, Celeste had always tried to find ways to spend more time with him. But she was also sensible. As long as he made his stance clear, she wouldn't dare make him upset.\nIn Jordyn's memory, Celeste always listened to Trevor. Since he said she wouldn't, she felt reassured. As a result, her mood lifted. She made her way into the villa cheerfully and told Hannah she wanted to take a bath.\n\"Sure, sure,\" Hannah replied to Jordyn. Then, she remembered Celeste's instructions and handed an envelope to Trevor. \"Mr. Fleming, this is from Mrs. Fleming. She asked me to give it to you.\"\nTrevor took the envelope and asked casually, \"Where is she?\"\n\"Mrs. Fleming packed up and went back to the country this afternoon. Didn't you know?\" Hannah responded.\nTrevor paused mid-step as he was heading upstairs. He turned back, feeling a little surprised. \"Has she gone back?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nWhy had Celeste suddenly come to Andostan? Trevor hadn't given her a chance to tell him about it. He hadn't cared to ask either. Upon learning she'd left, he didn't dwell on it.\nJordyn was a little surprised too. When she heard the news, she felt a small twinge of disappointment. She'd been thinking that even if Celeste didn't join them for the outing tomorrow, it might be nice to have her around at home in the evening.\nPolishing the seashells made her hands hurt\u2014she had been counting on Celeste's help in finishing the necklace.\nThough it had been months since Trevor and Celeste had seen each other, she had made the effort to visit but only to leave without seeing him in person. Hannah recalled Celeste's grim expression as she left and thought that things felt a little off.\nShe couldn't help but say, \"Mr. Fleming, Mrs. Fleming looked upset when she left. She seemed angry.\"\nHannah had assumed Celeste's sudden departure was due to an urgent matter. Upon realizing Trevor hadn't known she'd left, she began to feel something was amiss.\n\"Angry?\" Trevor repeated in his mind. \nIn his presence, Celeste had always been patient and accommodating. So, she could get angry too? This was new.\nTrevor smiled faintly and responded to Hannah perfunctorily before heading upstairs.\nBack in the bedroom, he was about to open the envelope Celeste had left when Wynn called. After answering the call, he tossed the envelope aside and walked out the door.\nA short while later, the envelope slipped off the bed onto the floor.\nThat night, Trevor didn't return home.\nThe next day, Hannah noticed the envelope on the floor when she was cleaning. Recognizing it as the one Celeste had asked her to hand over, she assumed Trevor had already seen it and placed it in a nearby drawer.\n\u2026\nRight after getting off the plane, Celeste went home and began packing her belongings. She had accumulated quite a few things in the house since she'd been living there for six years, after all. But she only took a few sets of clothes, two sets of daily necessities, and some books that were related to her field of study back in college.\nAfter their marriage, Trevor had been depositing money for her and Jordyn into two separate accounts every month. One account was hers, and the other was Jordyn's.\nHowever, Celeste was used to spending her own money only. She had never touched the money in Jordyn's account. Because she loved Trevor, whenever she went shopping and saw clothes, shoes, cufflinks, or ties that suited him, she couldn't help but buy them.\nIn contrast, she didn't have many expenses on a daily basis because all she did was go to work. Her heart and mind were always focused on Trevor and Jordyn. She wanted to give them the best of everything.\nMost of the money Trevor deposited into her bank account was spent on him and Jordyn.\nGiven this spending pattern, there shouldn't have been much money left in Celeste's account. But over the past year, her opportunities to buy things for Trevor and Jordyn had decreased significantly because they were in Andostan.\nNow, there were over three million dollars in her account. That amount might not matter to Trevor, but to her, it was no small sum. And since it was her money, Celeste didn't hesitate to transfer it out.\nShe left both cards behind, dragged her suitcase out the door, and didn't look back.\nCeleste had an apartment near her workplace, which was a little over 1,100 square feet. She'd bought it four years ago to support a friend who had been struggling to meet their sales targets. She had never lived there before.\nNow, the apartment came in handy. She had it cleaned regularly, so it wasn't dirty. After a quick tidy-up, it was ready to move in.\nAfter a long day, Celeste washed up and went to bed around 10:00 pm.\n\u2026\nThe shrill sound of an alarm jolted Celeste awake. Startled, her mind went blank for a moment.\nWhen she came to her senses, she realized that while it was 1:00 am here, it was 7:00 am in Andostan, where Trevor and Jordyn were. This was their usual breakfast time.\nEver since Jordyn had gone to live with Trevor in Andostan, Celeste had developed the habit of calling her at this time every day. As she was always exhausted from work and was used to going to bed early, she had set this alarm to ensure she wouldn't miss the call.\nAt first, Jordyn hadn't adapted well to living in Andostan and had missed her terribly. She had called Celeste constantly. But as time went on, the calls that used to be full of yearning and dependence had grown perfunctory and impatient.\nThe alarm was no longer necessary. She just hadn't been able to let go.\nSmiling bitterly, Celeste deleted the alarm and turned off her phone before going back to sleep.\n\u2026\nMeanwhile, Trevor and Jordyn were nearly done with breakfast. Though he knew Celeste usually called Jordyn at this time, he wasn't always home and hadn't paid much attention to the routine.\nHe noticed that Celeste hadn't called that day. The fact registered in his mind, but he didn't care. After finishing breakfast, he went upstairs to change.\nJordyn, finding Celeste increasingly annoying, had grown less fond of their calls. Upon realizing that Celeste hadn't called yet, she figured something must have come up.\nShe grabbed her backpack and bolted for the door.\nHannah hurried after her. \"Ms. Fleming, it's still early. There's no rush!\"\nJordyn ignored her and ran to the car happily. She was thrilled that Celeste hadn't called on time that day. If she stayed home, she might still have to talk to Celeste later. Well, she didn't want that!\n\u2026\nAfter getting married to Trevor, Celeste had joined Fleming Group for his sake. Now that she was planning to divorce him, she saw no reason to stay.\nThe next morning, Celeste handed her resignation letter to Zeke Jackson after arriving at the office.\nZeke was one of Trevor's personal secretaries. When he saw Celeste's resignation letter, he was extremely surprised.\nHe was one of the few in the company who knew about the relationship between Celeste and Trevor.\nAnyone familiar with Trevor knew that he didn't love Celeste. So, he had been cold to her and rarely went home after their marriage.\nTo get closer to and win over Trevor, Celeste had chosen to work at Fleming Group.\nHer initial goal was to become his personal secretary, but Trevor refused vehemently. Even when Arnold stepped in, he couldn't get Trevor to agree. In the end, Celeste had to settle for a position in the secretarial team, becoming one of Trevor's many ordinary secretaries.\nAt first, Zeke had worried that Celeste's presence in the secretarial team would create chaos. But to his surprise, she didn't bring them any trouble. Although Celeste used her position to get closer to Trevor, she was mindful of her timing and never overstepped her boundaries. \nOn the contrary, she worked diligently and performed exceptionally well, hoping to gain Trevor's respect. Whether during her pregnancy, childbirth, or any other time, she strictly adhered to company policies and never sought special treatment.\nOver the years, Celeste rose to become the head of the secretarial team. Zeke had observed her feelings for Trevor from the sidelines all the while. To be honest, he had never imagined she would resign one day. He felt skeptical about her willingly giving up her position.\nSomething must have happened between Celeste and Trevor for her to resign now. Zeke understood that this was something he wasn't privy to\u2014it must be something significant enough for Trevor to have ordered her to resign.\nWhile he found it a pity, Zeke maintained a professional tone. \"I acknowledge that I've received your resignation letter. I'll arrange for someone to take over your duties as soon as possible.\"\n\"Alright.\" Celeste nodded and returned to her workstation.\nAfter working for a while, Zeke started an online meeting with Trevor to report on company matters. As the conversation neared its end, he suddenly remembered Celeste's resignation. \n\"Oh, Mr. Fleming, there's one more thing\u2014\"\nAlthough Zeke had told Celeste he would quickly arrange for someone to take over her position, he wanted to gauge Trevor's thoughts on the matter first. If Trevor wanted Celeste out immediately, he would make the arrangements right away.\nBut as the words left his mouth, he remembered that when Celeste first joined the company, Trevor had explicitly stated that all matters regarding her employment should be handled per company regulations. He made it clear that there was no need to report anything to him since he wouldn't concern himself with her.\nAnd indeed, over the years, Trevor had never actively inquired about Celeste's work at the company.\nEven when he encountered her at work, he treated her like she was a complete stranger.\nWhen Celeste was set to be promoted a couple of years ago, the team had hesitated. Everyone was aware of Trevor's dislike for her. They had even brought it up with him to gauge his opinion back then.\nTrevor had frowned in annoyance and reiterated that he wouldn't interfere and that they should handle it according to company policy. He had emphasized that they shouldn't bring up Celeste's matters with him again.\nSeeing Zeke's hesitation, Trevor frowned. \"What is it?\"\nZeke snapped out of his thoughts and quickly replied, \"Oh, it's nothing.\"\nSince Trevor was already aware of Celeste's resignation but hadn't brought it up, it was clear that this matter wasn't important to him. So, Zeke decided to proceed as usual and handle the matter according to company regulations.\nWith that resolved, Trevor ended the call.\n\u2026\n\"What are you thinking about?\" At noon, a colleague patted Celeste on the shoulder.\nCeleste came back to her senses and smiled, shaking her head. \"Nothing.\"\n\"Don't you need to call your daughter today?\"\n\"No, not today.\"\nTypically, she called Jordyn twice a day\u2014once at 1:00 am and once at around 12:00 pm.\nHer colleagues at work were aware of this habit. What they didn't know was her daughter was the child she had with the company's CEO.\nAfter work, Celeste went to the supermarket. She bought some groceries and a few potted plants before heading home.\nAfter dinner, she browsed online for information about the upcoming technology exhibition. \nAfter that, she made a call. \"Please reserve a ticket for next month's tech exhibition for me.\"\n\"Are you sure?\" the person on the other end replied coolly. \"The last two times you asked me to reserve tickets, you didn't show up. Do you know how many people's lifelong dream is to get one of those tickets? You wasted them thoughtlessly.\"\nThe annual tech exhibition was a major event in the industry, and tickets were not easily obtainable.\nTheir company had a limited number of slots, and many IT elites working for them eagerly vied for the opportunity to attend it.\n\"If I don't show up to the exhibition this time, I will never ask you to reserve a ticket for me ever again,\" Celeste promised.\nThere was silence on the other end before the line disconnected. \nCeleste knew that he'd agreed. The corners of her mouth tugged upward into a smile. What she hadn't said was that she wanted to return to the company.\nThough she was one of the partners of her tech firm, she had stepped back during its early days to focus on marriage and family. Her decision had disrupted their development plans and cost them many opportunities.\nHer colleagues had been both angry and frustrated with her. Over the years, they had rarely been in contact.\nWhile Celeste was eager to return, she knew she had been out of the industry for too long. If she went back unprepared, she was worried she wouldn't be able to keep up with the company's current pace.\nSo, she planned to spend some time familiarizing herself with the industry's latest developments before making a concrete decision.\nFor the next few days, Celeste focused on her work during office hours and spent her evenings tending to her own matters. She didn't reach out to Jordyn or Trevor, and they didn't contact her either.\nCeleste wasn't surprised. For over half a year, her communication with them had been one-sided. They had only passively responded to her efforts.\n\u2026\nMeanwhile, in Andostan, Jordyn had developed the habit of calling Wynn first thing every morning.\nThat day, she called Wynn right after waking up as usual. However, the call didn't last long before she burst into tears.\nWynn had told her some bad news. \"I'm going back to the country soon.\"\nDevastated, Jordyn finished the call and immediately phoned Trevor. \"Dad, did you know about this?\"\nAt his office, Trevor flipped through some documents. \"Yes.\"\n\"When did you find out?\"\n\"It's been a while.\"\n\"Dad, you're so mean\u2026\" Jordyn hugged her pink stuffed pig and cried loudly. \"I don't want Wynn to leave. If she's not here, I don't want to go to school here anymore. I want to go back too!\"\nTrevor's tone remained even. \"It's already being arranged.\"\nJordyn didn't understand. \"W-What do you mean?\"\n\"We're going back next week.\"\nJordyn jumped out of bed in excitement. \"Really?\"\n\"Yes, really,\" Trevor replied.\n\"Then why didn't Wynn tell me just now?\"\n\"It was just finalized. She doesn't know yet.\"\nJordyn was ecstatic. \"Dad, let's keep this a secret from Wynn. We'll surprise her when we go back to the country, okay?\"\n\"Alright.\"\n\"You're the best, Dad! I love you so much!\"\nAfter hanging up, Jordyn was still overjoyed. She sang and danced on her bed.\nAfter a while, she suddenly thought of Celeste. For the past few days, she had been in a great mood because Celeste hadn't called her. In fact, to avoid talking to Celeste, she had deliberately left home early and even turned off her phone or kept it far away from her after school.\nBut after two days, she was worried that Celeste might get angry if she found out. So, she stopped doing that. To her surprise, Celeste hadn't called at all in the days that followed.\nAt first, she thought Celeste had discovered that she was deliberately avoiding her calls. But then she remembered that based on past experiences, that wasn't very likely. If Celeste knew she had done something wrong, she would immediately ask Jordyn to correct her wrongdoing instead of sulking and not calling.\nAfter all, she was the most important person to Celeste. Jordyn knew that Celeste loved her the most, so she didn't think that Celeste would purposely refrain from calling her simply because she was upset.\nAs Jordyn thought about this, she suddenly missed Celeste. It was the first time in days she had thought about Celeste, and she couldn't resist dialing Celeste's number.\nBut just as the call connected, she remembered that while she would get to see Wynn after returning to the country, Celeste would undoubtedly try every possible way to prevent her from meeting Wynn. She wouldn't be able to see Wynn whenever she wanted like she could now.\nThis thought dampened Jordyn's mood.\nIt was midnight in Celeste's time zone. She was already asleep when she was woken by the call. Upon seeing Jordyn's name on the screen, she was about to answer when the call abruptly disconnected.\nAlthough Celeste had written in her divorce agreement that she would relinquish custody of Jordyn, she still felt a sense of responsibility as her mother. Worried that something might have happened, Celeste immediately called back.\nWhen Jordyn saw the incoming call, she turned her head away and refused to answer.\nCeleste became more concerned and quickly called the landline at the villa.\nHannah answered promptly. After hearing Celeste's concerns, she reassured her, \"Ms. Fleming should be fine. She went to bed late last night and woke up late today. When I checked earlier, she was still asleep. I'll go upstairs to take a look and call you back.\"\nFeeling relieved, Celeste replied, \"Thank you.\"\nWhen Hannah went upstairs, Jordyn was already in the bathroom brushing her teeth.\nAfter Hannah relayed Celeste being worried about her, Jordyn lowered her head and lied, \"I accidentally hit the call button.\"\nHannah believed her and didn't doubt what she said. Seeing that Jordyn was still brushing her teeth, she went back downstairs to update Celeste that Jordyn was fine.\nJordyn watched as Hannah left. She huffed and finally felt a bit better.\nAfter hearing Hannah's reassurance, Celeste felt relieved too. Still, having been abruptly woken, she struggled to fall back asleep. She wasn't in great shape the next morning at work.\nThe envelope containing the divorce agreement was completely forgotten by Trevor after the phone call with Wynn.\nOn the day they returned to the country, Trevor packed the last document into his briefcase and ensured that nothing was left behind before heading downstairs.\n\"All set. Let's go.\"\nThe Lincoln stretch limousine departed from the villa and headed to the airport.\n\u2026\nThat night, at around 10:00 pm, the plane carrying Trevor and Jordyn landed on time. By the time they got home, it was nearly midnight. \nJordyn had fallen asleep before they arrived. When Trevor carried her upstairs, he passed the master bedroom and noticed the door was open, but the room was pitch black.\nAfter putting Jordyn on her bed and tucking her in, he returned to the master bedroom and turned on the light. Then, he glanced at the bed and found that it was empty\u2014Celeste wasn't there.\nJust then, the butler, Peter Hawk, came upstairs with his luggage. \nLoosening his tie, Trevor asked, \"Where is she?\"\nPeter replied, \"Mrs. Fleming is on a business trip.\"\nHalf a month ago, Peter hadn't been around when Celeste had left with her suitcase. The other maids told him that Celeste left with a suitcase, so he had assumed she was traveling for work.\nNow that he thought about it, this was unusual. Celeste rarely went on business trips. Even when she did, they typically lasted only two or three days.\nThis time, she had been gone for over two weeks.\n\"Alright,\" Trevor responded indifferently, asking no further questions.\n...\nThe next day, Celeste unexpectedly ran into Trevor at the company. She hadn't known that Trevor and Jordyn had returned to the country. Caught off guard by their sudden encounter, Celeste froze mid-step.\nTrevor also seemed slightly surprised to see her, but he assumed she had just returned from the business trip and didn't think much of it.\nHe passed by her coldly, his face expressionless. As usual, he treated her like she was a stranger and turned to enter the building.\nIn the past, if Celeste had found out that he'd suddenly come back, she would have been overjoyed. Even if she couldn't throw herself into his arms in such a scenario, she would have been very happy and excited. Her eyes would light up as she greeted him. \nEven if Trevor remained indifferent, she would have smiled and wished him good morning enthusiastically.\nBut now, Celeste merely glanced at his handsome face before lowering her eyes. There was no longer any trace of the joy and excitement she once felt.\nTrevor didn't notice any of this and was already walking away.\nWatching his tall and composed figure disappear into the building, Celeste wondered when he had returned. Since he was back, perhaps the matter of their divorce could soon be addressed.\nHaving resolved to go through with the divorce, Celeste didn't dwell on him further. After she returned to her workstation, she quickly immersed herself in her work.\nHalf an hour later, Zeke called her and instructed her to do something. \"Prepare two cups of coffee and take them to Mr. Fleming's office.\"\nIn the early days of her marriage, Celeste had learned that Trevor enjoyed coffee. In hopes of winning his favor, she had spent a great deal of effort studying how to brew it perfectly. Her efforts had paid off. After tasting her coffee, Trevor began to specifically request it, both at home and at the office.\nWhen she first realized he genuinely liked the coffee she made, Celeste had been thrilled. She naively believed it was the first step toward gaining his approval.\nBut she had underestimated his dislike and wariness of her. While he liked her coffee, that was all he liked. His attitude toward her remained cold and distant.\nEven when he wanted her coffee, he would have Zeke reach out to her. Once the coffee was prepared, someone else would pick it up for him. He never gave her the opportunity to approach him herself.\nOnly on rare occasions when no one else was available did she get the chance to deliver it to his office personally.\nThis time, it seemed she was to take the coffee directly to Trevor herself from Zeke's tone. After brewing the coffee, Celeste placed the cups on a tray and carried them to his office.\nThe door to his office was ajar.\nAs she approached and was about to knock on the door politely, she saw Wynn sitting on Trevor's lap. The two of them seemed to be locked in a passionate kiss.\nCeleste stopped in her tracks, her face turning pale.\nUpon seeing her, Wynn shot up from Trevor's lap, looking flustered.\nTrevor's expression darkened, and he questioned in an icy tone, \"Who allowed you to come in?\"\n..."

                  "text": "Every time my husband filed for divorce, he had only one condition: I took all the property, and he only wanted our daughter.\nOn my birthday, I flew across the ocean to surprise them\u2026 and found him having dinner with his true love\u2014my stepsister.\nMy daughter looked at her and said, \u201cMommy.\u201d\nThat day, I finally woke up.\nI drafted the divorce papers, gave up custody, and walked away from it all, building a billion-dollar empire from scratch.\nBut when I returned home one night with a business partner, my ex husband cornered me against the wall.\n\u201cDivorce?\u201d he said, eyes dark. \u201cNot a chance.\u201d\n\nAfter seven years of marriage, my husband, Trevor, fell for another woman\u2014even our daughter wanted her as her new mom.\nI scoffed at the years I\u2019d wasted and handed him the divorce papers. Yet he dropped his usual aloofness, slamming me against the wall,\n\u201cDivorce? Not a chance.\u201d\n***\nWhen Celeste Rodriguez landed at the airport in Andostan, it was already past 9:00 pm.\nIt was her birthday. Her phone buzzed with messages from colleagues and friends\u2014but not a single one from her husband, Trevor Fleming.\nCeleste's smile faded.\nBy the time she reached the villa, it was already past 10:00 pm.\nHannah Lynd, the housekeeper looked startled. \"Mrs. Fleming... what a surprise.\"\n\"Where are Trevor and Jo?\" Celeste asked, handing over her luggage.\n\"Mr. Fleming isn\u2019t back yet. Miss Jordyn\u2019s upstairs playing.\"\nCeleste climbed the stairs. In her room, Jordyn sat in pajamas at her desk, completely absorbed.\n\"Jo?\" Celeste called.\nJordyn turned, her eyes lighting up. In a happy tone, she greeted, \"Mom!\"\nBut then she quickly got back to what she was doing earlier.\nCeleste walked over and hugged her tight, planting a kiss on her cheek. Yet the little one pushed her away and squirmed. \"Mom, I\u2019m busy.\" \nIt had been two months since Celeste last saw Jordyn. She missed her so much that no amount of kisses felt enough. She wanted to talk to Jordyn.\nShe noticed the necklace Jordyn was threading. \"Jo, are you making a seashell necklace?\"\n\"Mm-hm!\" Jordyn perked up visibly. \"Wynn's birthday is in a week. Dad and I picked and polished these ourselves. Pretty, right?\"\nCeleste\u2019s throat tightened. Jordyn didn\u2019t look up, only added brightly, \"Dad even got her a custom gift, tomorrow\u2014\"\nCeleste felt a pang in her chest and couldn't hold back anymore. \"Jo\u2026 Do you remember it's my birthday today?\"\n\"Huh?\" Jordyn glanced up briefly, then quickly looked back down at the string of beads in her hands, She complained, \"Mom, don\u2019t talk, Look, I messed up the bead order\u2014\"\nCeleste stood there in silence for a while, but Jordyn never looked back up. Finally, Celeste pursed her lips and left the room without another word.\nDownstairs, Hannah said, \"I called Mr. Fleming. He said he\u2019s busy tonight and you should rest first.\"\n\"I see.\" Celeste replied softly.\nShe hesitated, then called Trevor. It rang for a while before he answered.\nhis tone was indifferent as usual. \"I'm busy. Let's talk tomorrow\u2014\"\nA woman\u2019s voice chimed in: \"Trevor, who is it?\"\nWynn.\nCeleste gripped the phone tighter.\n\"No one important,\" Trevor answered her.\nBefore Celeste could say anything, Trevor had already hung up.\nCeleste stared at the screen. Two or three months apart, and this was all he had for her.\nAfter so many years of marriage, he\u2019d always been cold. Distant. Impatient. \nShe had got used to chasing after him, calling again, begging for time. Yet tonight, she didn\u2019t bother. \nPerhaps she was just too tired.\n\nThe next morning, Celeste thought it over and decided to call Trevor again.\nThere was a time difference of about 17 or 18 hours between Andostan and their home country. In Andostan, today was her actual birthday.\nShe didn\u2019t just come here for Jordyn. She wanted one thing: a family meal. Her only birthday wish.\nYet, Trevor didn\u2019t answer.\nA long time later, he texted: What\u2019s up?\nShe replied: Lunch today? Just the three of us.\nTrevor answered: Okay. Send the address.\nAlright, she typed back.\nThat was it. No acknowledgment. No \u201cHappy birthday.\u201d She wasn\u2019t surprised. But it still stung.\nAs she headed downstairs, she overheard Jordyn talking with Hannah.\n\"Aren't you happy that Mrs. Fleming is here, sweetie?\" Hannah asked.\n\"Dad and I promised to take Wynn to the beach tomorrow. If Mom comes, it'll be weird. She\u2019s always mean to Wynn.\"\n\"Mrs. Fleming is still your mom, sweetie. That\u2019s hurtful.\"\n\"I know, but Dad and I like Wynn more. Can't Wynn be my mom instead?\"\nCeleste froze.\nShe had raised Jordyn herself most of the time. But over the past two years, the more time Jordyn spent with Trevor, the more attached she became to him. When Trevor came to Andostan to expand his business last year, Jordyn had insisted on coming along.\nCeleste was reluctant and had hoped Jordyn would stay by her side. But she couldn't bear to see Jordyn upset, so she agreed.\nAnd now, Jordyn didn\u2019t even want her as her mom anymore.\nCeleste stood frozen in place, her face pale. To think that she had pushed aside her work to come to Andostan with the intention of spending more time with Jordyn.\nNow, it seemed unnecessary.\nShe walked back to her room, pale and quiet, then repacked the gifts she\u2019d brought.\nLater, Hannah texted: Madame, I took Jordyn out. Let me know if you need anything.\nCeleste sat on the bed, feeling hollow and lost inside. She had abandoned her work and made this trip, only to find no one wanted her here.\nHer arrival was nothing but a joke.\n\nAfter a long while, she left the villa. Aimlessly, she drove around in this foreign yet familiar country.\nBy noon, she remembered she had planned to have lunch with Trevor and Jordyn. As she recalled what she had overheard in the morning, she hesitated about whether to go home and pick up Jordyn. \nThen, a text from Trevor came: Something came up. Lunch\u2019s canceled.\nCeleste stared at it.\nShe should\u2019ve known. Trevor always canceled on her.  His work, friends, and everything else always came before her, his wife.\nOnce, she\u2019d cry. Today, she just felt\u2026 empty.\nCeleste was at an utter loss. She had come all this way excitedly only to be met with indifference from both Trevor and Jordyn.\nAimlessly, she drove around. Eventually, she found herself outside an old favorite restaurant which she and Trevor used to frequent.\nJust as she was about to walk in, she saw them.\nTrevor. Jordyn. Wynn.\nWynn sat next to Jordyn, laughing, feeding the little one the pastries she had taken a bite out of. Jordyn giggled, with her legs swinging around happily. Trevor smiled as he served food to both of them, but his gaze never left Wynn.\nWhat a happy family of three!\nSo this was his \"something came up.\"\nAnd this was the daughter she had carried for ten long months and nearly lost her life to bring into this world.\nCeleste laughed humorlessly. She stood there watching for a long time. Finally, she turned and drove away.\n\nBack at the villa, Celeste drafted the divorce agreement.\nTrevor had been her teenage dream\u2014but he had never truly seen her. If not for that one night and his grandfather Arnold Fleming\u2019s pressure, he never would\u2019ve married her. She thought loving him hard enough would be enough, but seven years proved otherwise.\nFor a long time, she felt lucky to have Jo\u2014her only source of comfort. But now, even Jo didn\u2019t seem to want her.\nThat was it.\nShe was done\u2014with the marriage, the lies, the thankless role of wife and mother. It was time to leave all this behind\u2014and reclaim the promising life she'd given up!\nShe sealed the divorce papers, handed them to Hannah, then grabbed her suitcase and walked out, bound for the airport. On the way, she finally dialed the number she\u2019d been avoiding for months.\nThe line rang once. Twice. A click.\n\u201cHello?\u201d\nShe took a breath, steady and sharp.\u201cThat offer still stand?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d\n...\nAt around 9:00 pm, Trevor and Jordyn returned home.\nJordyn clung to the hem of Trevor's coat and got out of the car sluggishly. Because Celeste was at home, she was reluctant to return that night.\nBut Wynn had said that Celeste came specifically to be with her and Trevor, and if they didn't return, she would be sad. Trevor also said that if they didn't go home that night, Celeste would definitely insist on joining them on their outing to the sea the next day.\nReluctantly, Jordyn agreed to come home.\nStill worried, she muttered gloomily, \"Dad, what if Mom insists on tagging along with us tomorrow?\"\n\"She won't,\" Trevor replied confidently.\nIn all the years they'd been married, Celeste had always tried to find ways to spend more time with him. But she was also sensible. As long as he made his stance clear, she wouldn't dare make him upset.\nIn Jordyn's memory, Celeste always listened to Trevor. Since he said she wouldn't, she felt reassured. As a result, her mood lifted. She made her way into the villa cheerfully and told Hannah she wanted to take a bath.\n\"Sure, sure,\" Hannah replied to Jordyn. Then, she remembered Celeste's instructions and handed an envelope to Trevor. \"Mr. Fleming, this is from Mrs. Fleming. She asked me to give it to you.\"\nTrevor took the envelope and asked casually, \"Where is she?\"\n\"Mrs. Fleming packed up and went back to the country this afternoon. Didn't you know?\" Hannah responded.\nTrevor paused mid-step as he was heading upstairs. He turned back, feeling a little surprised. \"Has she gone back?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nWhy had Celeste suddenly come to Andostan? Trevor hadn't given her a chance to tell him about it. He hadn't cared to ask either. Upon learning she'd left, he didn't dwell on it.\nJordyn was a little surprised too. When she heard the news, she felt a small twinge of disappointment. She'd been thinking that even if Celeste didn't join them for the outing tomorrow, it might be nice to have her around at home in the evening.\nPolishing the seashells made her hands hurt\u2014she had been counting on Celeste's help in finishing the necklace.\nThough it had been months since Trevor and Celeste had seen each other, she had made the effort to visit but only to leave without seeing him in person. Hannah recalled Celeste's grim expression as she left and thought that things felt a little off.\nShe couldn't help but say, \"Mr. Fleming, Mrs. Fleming looked upset when she left. She seemed angry.\"\nHannah had assumed Celeste's sudden departure was due to an urgent matter. Upon realizing Trevor hadn't known she'd left, she began to feel something was amiss.\n\"Angry?\" Trevor repeated in his mind. \nIn his presence, Celeste had always been patient and accommodating. So, she could get angry too? This was new.\nTrevor smiled faintly and responded to Hannah perfunctorily before heading upstairs.\nBack in the bedroom, he was about to open the envelope Celeste had left when Wynn called. After answering the call, he tossed the envelope aside and walked out the door.\nA short while later, the envelope slipped off the bed onto the floor.\nThat night, Trevor didn't return home.\nThe next day, Hannah noticed the envelope on the floor when she was cleaning. Recognizing it as the one Celeste had asked her to hand over, she assumed Trevor had already seen it and placed it in a nearby drawer.\n\u2026\nRight after getting off the plane, Celeste went home and began packing her belongings. She had accumulated quite a few things in the house since she'd been living there for six years, after all. But she only took a few sets of clothes, two sets of daily necessities, and some books that were related to her field of study back in college.\nAfter their marriage, Trevor had been depositing money for her and Jordyn into two separate accounts every month. One account was hers, and the other was Jordyn's.\nHowever, Celeste was used to spending her own money only. She had never touched the money in Jordyn's account. Because she loved Trevor, whenever she went shopping and saw clothes, shoes, cufflinks, or ties that suited him, she couldn't help but buy them.\nIn contrast, she didn't have many expenses on a daily basis because all she did was go to work. Her heart and mind were always focused on Trevor and Jordyn. She wanted to give them the best of everything.\nMost of the money Trevor deposited into her bank account was spent on him and Jordyn.\nGiven this spending pattern, there shouldn't have been much money left in Celeste's account. But over the past year, her opportunities to buy things for Trevor and Jordyn had decreased significantly because they were in Andostan.\nNow, there were over three million dollars in her account. That amount might not matter to Trevor, but to her, it was no small sum. And since it was her money, Celeste didn't hesitate to transfer it out.\nShe left both cards behind, dragged her suitcase out the door, and didn't look back.\nCeleste had an apartment near her workplace, which was a little over 1,100 square feet. She'd bought it four years ago to support a friend who had been struggling to meet their sales targets. She had never lived there before.\nNow, the apartment came in handy. She had it cleaned regularly, so it wasn't dirty. After a quick tidy-up, it was ready to move in.\nAfter a long day, Celeste washed up and went to bed around 10:00 pm.\n\u2026\nThe shrill sound of an alarm jolted Celeste awake. Startled, her mind went blank for a moment.\nWhen she came to her senses, she realized that while it was 1:00 am here, it was 7:00 am in Andostan, where Trevor and Jordyn were. This was their usual breakfast time.\nEver since Jordyn had gone to live with Trevor in Andostan, Celeste had developed the habit of calling her at this time every day. As she was always exhausted from work and was used to going to bed early, she had set this alarm to ensure she wouldn't miss the call.\nAt first, Jordyn hadn't adapted well to living in Andostan and had missed her terribly. She had called Celeste constantly. But as time went on, the calls that used to be full of yearning and dependence had grown perfunctory and impatient.\nThe alarm was no longer necessary. She just hadn't been able to let go.\nSmiling bitterly, Celeste deleted the alarm and turned off her phone before going back to sleep.\n\u2026\nMeanwhile, Trevor and Jordyn were nearly done with breakfast. Though he knew Celeste usually called Jordyn at this time, he wasn't always home and hadn't paid much attention to the routine.\nHe noticed that Celeste hadn't called that day. The fact registered in his mind, but he didn't care. After finishing breakfast, he went upstairs to change.\nJordyn, finding Celeste increasingly annoying, had grown less fond of their calls. Upon realizing that Celeste hadn't called yet, she figured something must have come up.\nShe grabbed her backpack and bolted for the door.\nHannah hurried after her. \"Ms. Fleming, it's still early. There's no rush!\"\nJordyn ignored her and ran to the car happily. She was thrilled that Celeste hadn't called on time that day. If she stayed home, she might still have to talk to Celeste later. Well, she didn't want that!\n\u2026\nAfter getting married to Trevor, Celeste had joined Fleming Group for his sake. Now that she was planning to divorce him, she saw no reason to stay.\nThe next morning, Celeste handed her resignation letter to Zeke Jackson after arriving at the office.\nZeke was one of Trevor's personal secretaries. When he saw Celeste's resignation letter, he was extremely surprised.\nHe was one of the few in the company who knew about the relationship between Celeste and Trevor.\nAnyone familiar with Trevor knew that he didn't love Celeste. So, he had been cold to her and rarely went home after their marriage.\nTo get closer to and win over Trevor, Celeste had chosen to work at Fleming Group.\nHer initial goal was to become his personal secretary, but Trevor refused vehemently. Even when Arnold stepped in, he couldn't get Trevor to agree. In the end, Celeste had to settle for a position in the secretarial team, becoming one of Trevor's many ordinary secretaries.\nAt first, Zeke had worried that Celeste's presence in the secretarial team would create chaos. But to his surprise, she didn't bring them any trouble. Although Celeste used her position to get closer to Trevor, she was mindful of her timing and never overstepped her boundaries. \nOn the contrary, she worked diligently and performed exceptionally well, hoping to gain Trevor's respect. Whether during her pregnancy, childbirth, or any other time, she strictly adhered to company policies and never sought special treatment.\nOver the years, Celeste rose to become the head of the secretarial team. Zeke had observed her feelings for Trevor from the sidelines all the while. To be honest, he had never imagined she would resign one day. He felt skeptical about her willingly giving up her position.\nSomething must have happened between Celeste and Trevor for her to resign now. Zeke understood that this was something he wasn't privy to\u2014it must be something significant enough for Trevor to have ordered her to resign.\nWhile he found it a pity, Zeke maintained a professional tone. \"I acknowledge that I've received your resignation letter. I'll arrange for someone to take over your duties as soon as possible.\"\n\"Alright.\" Celeste nodded and returned to her workstation.\nAfter working for a while, Zeke started an online meeting with Trevor to report on company matters. As the conversation neared its end, he suddenly remembered Celeste's resignation. \n\"Oh, Mr. Fleming, there's one more thing\u2014\"\nAlthough Zeke had told Celeste he would quickly arrange for someone to take over her position, he wanted to gauge Trevor's thoughts on the matter first. If Trevor wanted Celeste out immediately, he would make the arrangements right away.\nBut as the words left his mouth, he remembered that when Celeste first joined the company, Trevor had explicitly stated that all matters regarding her employment should be handled per company regulations. He made it clear that there was no need to report anything to him since he wouldn't concern himself with her.\nAnd indeed, over the years, Trevor had never actively inquired about Celeste's work at the company.\nEven when he encountered her at work, he treated her like she was a complete stranger.\nWhen Celeste was set to be promoted a couple of years ago, the team had hesitated. Everyone was aware of Trevor's dislike for her. They had even brought it up with him to gauge his opinion back then.\nTrevor had frowned in annoyance and reiterated that he wouldn't interfere and that they should handle it according to company policy. He had emphasized that they shouldn't bring up Celeste's matters with him again.\nSeeing Zeke's hesitation, Trevor frowned. \"What is it?\"\nZeke snapped out of his thoughts and quickly replied, \"Oh, it's nothing.\"\nSince Trevor was already aware of Celeste's resignation but hadn't brought it up, it was clear that this matter wasn't important to him. So, Zeke decided to proceed as usual and handle the matter according to company regulations.\nWith that resolved, Trevor ended the call.\n\u2026\n\"What are you thinking about?\" At noon, a colleague patted Celeste on the shoulder.\nCeleste came back to her senses and smiled, shaking her head. \"Nothing.\"\n\"Don't you need to call your daughter today?\"\n\"No, not today.\"\nTypically, she called Jordyn twice a day\u2014once at 1:00 am and once at around 12:00 pm.\nHer colleagues at work were aware of this habit. What they didn't know was her daughter was the child she had with the company's CEO.\nAfter work, Celeste went to the supermarket. She bought some groceries and a few potted plants before heading home.\nAfter dinner, she browsed online for information about the upcoming technology exhibition. \nAfter that, she made a call. \"Please reserve a ticket for next month's tech exhibition for me.\"\n\"Are you sure?\" the person on the other end replied coolly. \"The last two times you asked me to reserve tickets, you didn't show up. Do you know how many people's lifelong dream is to get one of those tickets? You wasted them thoughtlessly.\"\nThe annual tech exhibition was a major event in the industry, and tickets were not easily obtainable.\nTheir company had a limited number of slots, and many IT elites working for them eagerly vied for the opportunity to attend it.\n\"If I don't show up to the exhibition this time, I will never ask you to reserve a ticket for me ever again,\" Celeste promised.\nThere was silence on the other end before the line disconnected. \nCeleste knew that he'd agreed. The corners of her mouth tugged upward into a smile. What she hadn't said was that she wanted to return to the company.\nThough she was one of the partners of her tech firm, she had stepped back during its early days to focus on marriage and family. Her decision had disrupted their development plans and cost them many opportunities.\nHer colleagues had been both angry and frustrated with her. Over the years, they had rarely been in contact.\nWhile Celeste was eager to return, she knew she had been out of the industry for too long. If she went back unprepared, she was worried she wouldn't be able to keep up with the company's current pace.\nSo, she planned to spend some time familiarizing herself with the industry's latest developments before making a concrete decision.\nFor the next few days, Celeste focused on her work during office hours and spent her evenings tending to her own matters. She didn't reach out to Jordyn or Trevor, and they didn't contact her either.\nCeleste wasn't surprised. For over half a year, her communication with them had been one-sided. They had only passively responded to her efforts.\n\u2026\nMeanwhile, in Andostan, Jordyn had developed the habit of calling Wynn first thing every morning.\nThat day, she called Wynn right after waking up as usual. However, the call didn't last long before she burst into tears.\nWynn had told her some bad news. \"I'm going back to the country soon.\"\nDevastated, Jordyn finished the call and immediately phoned Trevor. \"Dad, did you know about this?\"\nAt his office, Trevor flipped through some documents. \"Yes.\"\n\"When did you find out?\"\n\"It's been a while.\"\n\"Dad, you're so mean\u2026\" Jordyn hugged her pink stuffed pig and cried loudly. \"I don't want Wynn to leave. If she's not here, I don't want to go to school here anymore. I want to go back too!\"\nTrevor's tone remained even. \"It's already being arranged.\"\nJordyn didn't understand. \"W-What do you mean?\"\n\"We're going back next week.\"\nJordyn jumped out of bed in excitement. \"Really?\"\n\"Yes, really,\" Trevor replied.\n\"Then why didn't Wynn tell me just now?\"\n\"It was just finalized. She doesn't know yet.\"\nJordyn was ecstatic. \"Dad, let's keep this a secret from Wynn. We'll surprise her when we go back to the country, okay?\"\n\"Alright.\"\n\"You're the best, Dad! I love you so much!\"\nAfter hanging up, Jordyn was still overjoyed. She sang and danced on her bed.\nAfter a while, she suddenly thought of Celeste. For the past few days, she had been in a great mood because Celeste hadn't called her. In fact, to avoid talking to Celeste, she had deliberately left home early and even turned off her phone or kept it far away from her after school.\nBut after two days, she was worried that Celeste might get angry if she found out. So, she stopped doing that. To her surprise, Celeste hadn't called at all in the days that followed.\nAt first, she thought Celeste had discovered that she was deliberately avoiding her calls. But then she remembered that based on past experiences, that wasn't very likely. If Celeste knew she had done something wrong, she would immediately ask Jordyn to correct her wrongdoing instead of sulking and not calling.\nAfter all, she was the most important person to Celeste. Jordyn knew that Celeste loved her the most, so she didn't think that Celeste would purposely refrain from calling her simply because she was upset.\nAs Jordyn thought about this, she suddenly missed Celeste. It was the first time in days she had thought about Celeste, and she couldn't resist dialing Celeste's number.\nBut just as the call connected, she remembered that while she would get to see Wynn after returning to the country, Celeste would undoubtedly try every possible way to prevent her from meeting Wynn. She wouldn't be able to see Wynn whenever she wanted like she could now.\nThis thought dampened Jordyn's mood.\nIt was midnight in Celeste's time zone. She was already asleep when she was woken by the call. Upon seeing Jordyn's name on the screen, she was about to answer when the call abruptly disconnected.\nAlthough Celeste had written in her divorce agreement that she would relinquish custody of Jordyn, she still felt a sense of responsibility as her mother. Worried that something might have happened, Celeste immediately called back.\nWhen Jordyn saw the incoming call, she turned her head away and refused to answer.\nCeleste became more concerned and quickly called the landline at the villa.\nHannah answered promptly. After hearing Celeste's concerns, she reassured her, \"Ms. Fleming should be fine. She went to bed late last night and woke up late today. When I checked earlier, she was still asleep. I'll go upstairs to take a look and call you back.\"\nFeeling relieved, Celeste replied, \"Thank you.\"\nWhen Hannah went upstairs, Jordyn was already in the bathroom brushing her teeth.\nAfter Hannah relayed Celeste being worried about her, Jordyn lowered her head and lied, \"I accidentally hit the call button.\"\nHannah believed her and didn't doubt what she said. Seeing that Jordyn was still brushing her teeth, she went back downstairs to update Celeste that Jordyn was fine.\nJordyn watched as Hannah left. She huffed and finally felt a bit better.\nAfter hearing Hannah's reassurance, Celeste felt relieved too. Still, having been abruptly woken, she struggled to fall back asleep. She wasn't in great shape the next morning at work.\nThe envelope containing the divorce agreement was completely forgotten by Trevor after the phone call with Wynn.\nOn the day they returned to the country, Trevor packed the last document into his briefcase and ensured that nothing was left behind before heading downstairs.\n\"All set. Let's go.\"\nThe Lincoln stretch limousine departed from the villa and headed to the airport.\n\u2026\nThat night, at around 10:00 pm, the plane carrying Trevor and Jordyn landed on time. By the time they got home, it was nearly midnight. \nJordyn had fallen asleep before they arrived. When Trevor carried her upstairs, he passed the master bedroom and noticed the door was open, but the room was pitch black.\nAfter putting Jordyn on her bed and tucking her in, he returned to the master bedroom and turned on the light. Then, he glanced at the bed and found that it was empty\u2014Celeste wasn't there.\nJust then, the butler, Peter Hawk, came upstairs with his luggage. \nLoosening his tie, Trevor asked, \"Where is she?\"\nPeter replied, \"Mrs. Fleming is on a business trip.\"\nHalf a month ago, Peter hadn't been around when Celeste had left with her suitcase. The other maids told him that Celeste left with a suitcase, so he had assumed she was traveling for work.\nNow that he thought about it, this was unusual. Celeste rarely went on business trips. Even when she did, they typically lasted only two or three days.\nThis time, she had been gone for over two weeks.\n\"Alright,\" Trevor responded indifferently, asking no further questions.\n...\nThe next day, Celeste unexpectedly ran into Trevor at the company. She hadn't known that Trevor and Jordyn had returned to the country. Caught off guard by their sudden encounter, Celeste froze mid-step.\nTrevor also seemed slightly surprised to see her, but he assumed she had just returned from the business trip and didn't think much of it.\nHe passed by her coldly, his face expressionless. As usual, he treated her like she was a stranger and turned to enter the building.\nIn the past, if Celeste had found out that he'd suddenly come back, she would have been overjoyed. Even if she couldn't throw herself into his arms in such a scenario, she would have been very happy and excited. Her eyes would light up as she greeted him. \nEven if Trevor remained indifferent, she would have smiled and wished him good morning enthusiastically.\nBut now, Celeste merely glanced at his handsome face before lowering her eyes. There was no longer any trace of the joy and excitement she once felt.\nTrevor didn't notice any of this and was already walking away.\nWatching his tall and composed figure disappear into the building, Celeste wondered when he had returned. Since he was back, perhaps the matter of their divorce could soon be addressed.\nHaving resolved to go through with the divorce, Celeste didn't dwell on him further. After she returned to her workstation, she quickly immersed herself in her work.\nHalf an hour later, Zeke called her and instructed her to do something. \"Prepare two cups of coffee and take them to Mr. Fleming's office.\"\nIn the early days of her marriage, Celeste had learned that Trevor enjoyed coffee. In hopes of winning his favor, she had spent a great deal of effort studying how to brew it perfectly. Her efforts had paid off. After tasting her coffee, Trevor began to specifically request it, both at home and at the office.\nWhen she first realized he genuinely liked the coffee she made, Celeste had been thrilled. She naively believed it was the first step toward gaining his approval.\nBut she had underestimated his dislike and wariness of her. While he liked her coffee, that was all he liked. His attitude toward her remained cold and distant.\nEven when he wanted her coffee, he would have Zeke reach out to her. Once the coffee was prepared, someone else would pick it up for him. He never gave her the opportunity to approach him herself.\nOnly on rare occasions when no one else was available did she get the chance to deliver it to his office personally.\nThis time, it seemed she was to take the coffee directly to Trevor herself from Zeke's tone. After brewing the coffee, Celeste placed the cups on a tray and carried them to his office.\nThe door to his office was ajar.\nAs she approached and was about to knock on the door politely, she saw Wynn sitting on Trevor's lap. The two of them seemed to be locked in a passionate kiss.\nCeleste stopped in her tracks, her face turning pale.\nUpon seeing her, Wynn shot up from Trevor's lap, looking flustered.\nTrevor's expression darkened, and he questioned in an icy tone, \"Who allowed you to come in?\"\n..."

                  "text": "Every time my husband filed for divorce, he had only one condition: I took all the property, and he only wanted our daughter.\nOn my birthday, I flew across the ocean to surprise them\u2026 and found him having dinner with his true love\u2014my stepsister.\nMy daughter looked at her and said, \u201cMommy.\u201d\nThat day, I finally woke up.\nI drafted the divorce papers, gave up custody, and walked away from it all, building a billion-dollar empire from scratch.\nBut when I returned home one night with a business partner, my ex husband cornered me against the wall.\n\u201cDivorce?\u201d he said, eyes dark. \u201cNot a chance.\u201d\n\nAfter seven years of marriage, my husband, Trevor, fell for another woman\u2014even our daughter wanted her as her new mom.\nI scoffed at the years I\u2019d wasted and handed him the divorce papers. Yet he dropped his usual aloofness, slamming me against the wall,\n\u201cDivorce? Not a chance.\u201d\n***\nWhen Celeste Rodriguez landed at the airport in Andostan, it was already past 9:00 pm.\nIt was her birthday. Her phone buzzed with messages from colleagues and friends\u2014but not a single one from her husband, Trevor Fleming.\nCeleste's smile faded.\nBy the time she reached the villa, it was already past 10:00 pm.\nHannah Lynd, the housekeeper looked startled. \"Mrs. Fleming... what a surprise.\"\n\"Where are Trevor and Jo?\" Celeste asked, handing over her luggage.\n\"Mr. Fleming isn\u2019t back yet. Miss Jordyn\u2019s upstairs playing.\"\nCeleste climbed the stairs. In her room, Jordyn sat in pajamas at her desk, completely absorbed.\n\"Jo?\" Celeste called.\nJordyn turned, her eyes lighting up. In a happy tone, she greeted, \"Mom!\"\nBut then she quickly got back to what she was doing earlier.\nCeleste walked over and hugged her tight, planting a kiss on her cheek. Yet the little one pushed her away and squirmed. \"Mom, I\u2019m busy.\" \nIt had been two months since Celeste last saw Jordyn. She missed her so much that no amount of kisses felt enough. She wanted to talk to Jordyn.\nShe noticed the necklace Jordyn was threading. \"Jo, are you making a seashell necklace?\"\n\"Mm-hm!\" Jordyn perked up visibly. \"Wynn's birthday is in a week. Dad and I picked and polished these ourselves. Pretty, right?\"\nCeleste\u2019s throat tightened. Jordyn didn\u2019t look up, only added brightly, \"Dad even got her a custom gift, tomorrow\u2014\"\nCeleste felt a pang in her chest and couldn't hold back anymore. \"Jo\u2026 Do you remember it's my birthday today?\"\n\"Huh?\" Jordyn glanced up briefly, then quickly looked back down at the string of beads in her hands, She complained, \"Mom, don\u2019t talk, Look, I messed up the bead order\u2014\"\nCeleste stood there in silence for a while, but Jordyn never looked back up. Finally, Celeste pursed her lips and left the room without another word.\nDownstairs, Hannah said, \"I called Mr. Fleming. He said he\u2019s busy tonight and you should rest first.\"\n\"I see.\" Celeste replied softly.\nShe hesitated, then called Trevor. It rang for a while before he answered.\nhis tone was indifferent as usual. \"I'm busy. Let's talk tomorrow\u2014\"\nA woman\u2019s voice chimed in: \"Trevor, who is it?\"\nWynn.\nCeleste gripped the phone tighter.\n\"No one important,\" Trevor answered her.\nBefore Celeste could say anything, Trevor had already hung up.\nCeleste stared at the screen. Two or three months apart, and this was all he had for her.\nAfter so many years of marriage, he\u2019d always been cold. Distant. Impatient. \nShe had got used to chasing after him, calling again, begging for time. Yet tonight, she didn\u2019t bother. \nPerhaps she was just too tired.\n\nThe next morning, Celeste thought it over and decided to call Trevor again.\nThere was a time difference of about 17 or 18 hours between Andostan and their home country. In Andostan, today was her actual birthday.\nShe didn\u2019t just come here for Jordyn. She wanted one thing: a family meal. Her only birthday wish.\nYet, Trevor didn\u2019t answer.\nA long time later, he texted: What\u2019s up?\nShe replied: Lunch today? Just the three of us.\nTrevor answered: Okay. Send the address.\nAlright, she typed back.\nThat was it. No acknowledgment. No \u201cHappy birthday.\u201d She wasn\u2019t surprised. But it still stung.\nAs she headed downstairs, she overheard Jordyn talking with Hannah.\n\"Aren't you happy that Mrs. Fleming is here, sweetie?\" Hannah asked.\n\"Dad and I promised to take Wynn to the beach tomorrow. If Mom comes, it'll be weird. She\u2019s always mean to Wynn.\"\n\"Mrs. Fleming is still your mom, sweetie. That\u2019s hurtful.\"\n\"I know, but Dad and I like Wynn more. Can't Wynn be my mom instead?\"\nCeleste froze.\nShe had raised Jordyn herself most of the time. But over the past two years, the more time Jordyn spent with Trevor, the more attached she became to him. When Trevor came to Andostan to expand his business last year, Jordyn had insisted on coming along.\nCeleste was reluctant and had hoped Jordyn would stay by her side. But she couldn't bear to see Jordyn upset, so she agreed.\nAnd now, Jordyn didn\u2019t even want her as her mom anymore.\nCeleste stood frozen in place, her face pale. To think that she had pushed aside her work to come to Andostan with the intention of spending more time with Jordyn.\nNow, it seemed unnecessary.\nShe walked back to her room, pale and quiet, then repacked the gifts she\u2019d brought.\nLater, Hannah texted: Madame, I took Jordyn out. Let me know if you need anything.\nCeleste sat on the bed, feeling hollow and lost inside. She had abandoned her work and made this trip, only to find no one wanted her here.\nHer arrival was nothing but a joke.\n\nAfter a long while, she left the villa. Aimlessly, she drove around in this foreign yet familiar country.\nBy noon, she remembered she had planned to have lunch with Trevor and Jordyn. As she recalled what she had overheard in the morning, she hesitated about whether to go home and pick up Jordyn. \nThen, a text from Trevor came: Something came up. Lunch\u2019s canceled.\nCeleste stared at it.\nShe should\u2019ve known. Trevor always canceled on her.  His work, friends, and everything else always came before her, his wife.\nOnce, she\u2019d cry. Today, she just felt\u2026 empty.\nCeleste was at an utter loss. She had come all this way excitedly only to be met with indifference from both Trevor and Jordyn.\nAimlessly, she drove around. Eventually, she found herself outside an old favorite restaurant which she and Trevor used to frequent.\nJust as she was about to walk in, she saw them.\nTrevor. Jordyn. Wynn.\nWynn sat next to Jordyn, laughing, feeding the little one the pastries she had taken a bite out of. Jordyn giggled, with her legs swinging around happily. Trevor smiled as he served food to both of them, but his gaze never left Wynn.\nWhat a happy family of three!\nSo this was his \"something came up.\"\nAnd this was the daughter she had carried for ten long months and nearly lost her life to bring into this world.\nCeleste laughed humorlessly. She stood there watching for a long time. Finally, she turned and drove away.\n\nBack at the villa, Celeste drafted the divorce agreement.\nTrevor had been her teenage dream\u2014but he had never truly seen her. If not for that one night and his grandfather Arnold Fleming\u2019s pressure, he never would\u2019ve married her. She thought loving him hard enough would be enough, but seven years proved otherwise.\nFor a long time, she felt lucky to have Jo\u2014her only source of comfort. But now, even Jo didn\u2019t seem to want her.\nThat was it.\nShe was done\u2014with the marriage, the lies, the thankless role of wife and mother. It was time to leave all this behind\u2014and reclaim the promising life she'd given up!\nShe sealed the divorce papers, handed them to Hannah, then grabbed her suitcase and walked out, bound for the airport. On the way, she finally dialed the number she\u2019d been avoiding for months.\nThe line rang once. Twice. A click.\n\u201cHello?\u201d\nShe took a breath, steady and sharp.\u201cThat offer still stand?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d\n...\nAt around 9:00 pm, Trevor and Jordyn returned home.\nJordyn clung to the hem of Trevor's coat and got out of the car sluggishly. Because Celeste was at home, she was reluctant to return that night.\nBut Wynn had said that Celeste came specifically to be with her and Trevor, and if they didn't return, she would be sad. Trevor also said that if they didn't go home that night, Celeste would definitely insist on joining them on their outing to the sea the next day.\nReluctantly, Jordyn agreed to come home.\nStill worried, she muttered gloomily, \"Dad, what if Mom insists on tagging along with us tomorrow?\"\n\"She won't,\" Trevor replied confidently.\nIn all the years they'd been married, Celeste had always tried to find ways to spend more time with him. But she was also sensible. As long as he made his stance clear, she wouldn't dare make him upset.\nIn Jordyn's memory, Celeste always listened to Trevor. Since he said she wouldn't, she felt reassured. As a result, her mood lifted. She made her way into the villa cheerfully and told Hannah she wanted to take a bath.\n\"Sure, sure,\" Hannah replied to Jordyn. Then, she remembered Celeste's instructions and handed an envelope to Trevor. \"Mr. Fleming, this is from Mrs. Fleming. She asked me to give it to you.\"\nTrevor took the envelope and asked casually, \"Where is she?\"\n\"Mrs. Fleming packed up and went back to the country this afternoon. Didn't you know?\" Hannah responded.\nTrevor paused mid-step as he was heading upstairs. He turned back, feeling a little surprised. \"Has she gone back?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nWhy had Celeste suddenly come to Andostan? Trevor hadn't given her a chance to tell him about it. He hadn't cared to ask either. Upon learning she'd left, he didn't dwell on it.\nJordyn was a little surprised too. When she heard the news, she felt a small twinge of disappointment. She'd been thinking that even if Celeste didn't join them for the outing tomorrow, it might be nice to have her around at home in the evening.\nPolishing the seashells made her hands hurt\u2014she had been counting on Celeste's help in finishing the necklace.\nThough it had been months since Trevor and Celeste had seen each other, she had made the effort to visit but only to leave without seeing him in person. Hannah recalled Celeste's grim expression as she left and thought that things felt a little off.\nShe couldn't help but say, \"Mr. Fleming, Mrs. Fleming looked upset when she left. She seemed angry.\"\nHannah had assumed Celeste's sudden departure was due to an urgent matter. Upon realizing Trevor hadn't known she'd left, she began to feel something was amiss.\n\"Angry?\" Trevor repeated in his mind. \nIn his presence, Celeste had always been patient and accommodating. So, she could get angry too? This was new.\nTrevor smiled faintly and responded to Hannah perfunctorily before heading upstairs.\nBack in the bedroom, he was about to open the envelope Celeste had left when Wynn called. After answering the call, he tossed the envelope aside and walked out the door.\nA short while later, the envelope slipped off the bed onto the floor.\nThat night, Trevor didn't return home.\nThe next day, Hannah noticed the envelope on the floor when she was cleaning. Recognizing it as the one Celeste had asked her to hand over, she assumed Trevor had already seen it and placed it in a nearby drawer.\n\u2026\nRight after getting off the plane, Celeste went home and began packing her belongings. She had accumulated quite a few things in the house since she'd been living there for six years, after all. But she only took a few sets of clothes, two sets of daily necessities, and some books that were related to her field of study back in college.\nAfter their marriage, Trevor had been depositing money for her and Jordyn into two separate accounts every month. One account was hers, and the other was Jordyn's.\nHowever, Celeste was used to spending her own money only. She had never touched the money in Jordyn's account. Because she loved Trevor, whenever she went shopping and saw clothes, shoes, cufflinks, or ties that suited him, she couldn't help but buy them.\nIn contrast, she didn't have many expenses on a daily basis because all she did was go to work. Her heart and mind were always focused on Trevor and Jordyn. She wanted to give them the best of everything.\nMost of the money Trevor deposited into her bank account was spent on him and Jordyn.\nGiven this spending pattern, there shouldn't have been much money left in Celeste's account. But over the past year, her opportunities to buy things for Trevor and Jordyn had decreased significantly because they were in Andostan.\nNow, there were over three million dollars in her account. That amount might not matter to Trevor, but to her, it was no small sum. And since it was her money, Celeste didn't hesitate to transfer it out.\nShe left both cards behind, dragged her suitcase out the door, and didn't look back.\nCeleste had an apartment near her workplace, which was a little over 1,100 square feet. She'd bought it four years ago to support a friend who had been struggling to meet their sales targets. She had never lived there before.\nNow, the apartment came in handy. She had it cleaned regularly, so it wasn't dirty. After a quick tidy-up, it was ready to move in.\nAfter a long day, Celeste washed up and went to bed around 10:00 pm.\n\u2026\nThe shrill sound of an alarm jolted Celeste awake. Startled, her mind went blank for a moment.\nWhen she came to her senses, she realized that while it was 1:00 am here, it was 7:00 am in Andostan, where Trevor and Jordyn were. This was their usual breakfast time.\nEver since Jordyn had gone to live with Trevor in Andostan, Celeste had developed the habit of calling her at this time every day. As she was always exhausted from work and was used to going to bed early, she had set this alarm to ensure she wouldn't miss the call.\nAt first, Jordyn hadn't adapted well to living in Andostan and had missed her terribly. She had called Celeste constantly. But as time went on, the calls that used to be full of yearning and dependence had grown perfunctory and impatient.\nThe alarm was no longer necessary. She just hadn't been able to let go.\nSmiling bitterly, Celeste deleted the alarm and turned off her phone before going back to sleep.\n\u2026\nMeanwhile, Trevor and Jordyn were nearly done with breakfast. Though he knew Celeste usually called Jordyn at this time, he wasn't always home and hadn't paid much attention to the routine.\nHe noticed that Celeste hadn't called that day. The fact registered in his mind, but he didn't care. After finishing breakfast, he went upstairs to change.\nJordyn, finding Celeste increasingly annoying, had grown less fond of their calls. Upon realizing that Celeste hadn't called yet, she figured something must have come up.\nShe grabbed her backpack and bolted for the door.\nHannah hurried after her. \"Ms. Fleming, it's still early. There's no rush!\"\nJordyn ignored her and ran to the car happily. She was thrilled that Celeste hadn't called on time that day. If she stayed home, she might still have to talk to Celeste later. Well, she didn't want that!\n\u2026\nAfter getting married to Trevor, Celeste had joined Fleming Group for his sake. Now that she was planning to divorce him, she saw no reason to stay.\nThe next morning, Celeste handed her resignation letter to Zeke Jackson after arriving at the office.\nZeke was one of Trevor's personal secretaries. When he saw Celeste's resignation letter, he was extremely surprised.\nHe was one of the few in the company who knew about the relationship between Celeste and Trevor.\nAnyone familiar with Trevor knew that he didn't love Celeste. So, he had been cold to her and rarely went home after their marriage.\nTo get closer to and win over Trevor, Celeste had chosen to work at Fleming Group.\nHer initial goal was to become his personal secretary, but Trevor refused vehemently. Even when Arnold stepped in, he couldn't get Trevor to agree. In the end, Celeste had to settle for a position in the secretarial team, becoming one of Trevor's many ordinary secretaries.\nAt first, Zeke had worried that Celeste's presence in the secretarial team would create chaos. But to his surprise, she didn't bring them any trouble. Although Celeste used her position to get closer to Trevor, she was mindful of her timing and never overstepped her boundaries. \nOn the contrary, she worked diligently and performed exceptionally well, hoping to gain Trevor's respect. Whether during her pregnancy, childbirth, or any other time, she strictly adhered to company policies and never sought special treatment.\nOver the years, Celeste rose to become the head of the secretarial team. Zeke had observed her feelings for Trevor from the sidelines all the while. To be honest, he had never imagined she would resign one day. He felt skeptical about her willingly giving up her position.\nSomething must have happened between Celeste and Trevor for her to resign now. Zeke understood that this was something he wasn't privy to\u2014it must be something significant enough for Trevor to have ordered her to resign.\nWhile he found it a pity, Zeke maintained a professional tone. \"I acknowledge that I've received your resignation letter. I'll arrange for someone to take over your duties as soon as possible.\"\n\"Alright.\" Celeste nodded and returned to her workstation.\nAfter working for a while, Zeke started an online meeting with Trevor to report on company matters. As the conversation neared its end, he suddenly remembered Celeste's resignation. \n\"Oh, Mr. Fleming, there's one more thing\u2014\"\nAlthough Zeke had told Celeste he would quickly arrange for someone to take over her position, he wanted to gauge Trevor's thoughts on the matter first. If Trevor wanted Celeste out immediately, he would make the arrangements right away.\nBut as the words left his mouth, he remembered that when Celeste first joined the company, Trevor had explicitly stated that all matters regarding her employment should be handled per company regulations. He made it clear that there was no need to report anything to him since he wouldn't concern himself with her.\nAnd indeed, over the years, Trevor had never actively inquired about Celeste's work at the company.\nEven when he encountered her at work, he treated her like she was a complete stranger.\nWhen Celeste was set to be promoted a couple of years ago, the team had hesitated. Everyone was aware of Trevor's dislike for her. They had even brought it up with him to gauge his opinion back then.\nTrevor had frowned in annoyance and reiterated that he wouldn't interfere and that they should handle it according to company policy. He had emphasized that they shouldn't bring up Celeste's matters with him again.\nSeeing Zeke's hesitation, Trevor frowned. \"What is it?\"\nZeke snapped out of his thoughts and quickly replied, \"Oh, it's nothing.\"\nSince Trevor was already aware of Celeste's resignation but hadn't brought it up, it was clear that this matter wasn't important to him. So, Zeke decided to proceed as usual and handle the matter according to company regulations.\nWith that resolved, Trevor ended the call.\n\u2026\n\"What are you thinking about?\" At noon, a colleague patted Celeste on the shoulder.\nCeleste came back to her senses and smiled, shaking her head. \"Nothing.\"\n\"Don't you need to call your daughter today?\"\n\"No, not today.\"\nTypically, she called Jordyn twice a day\u2014once at 1:00 am and once at around 12:00 pm.\nHer colleagues at work were aware of this habit. What they didn't know was her daughter was the child she had with the company's CEO.\nAfter work, Celeste went to the supermarket. She bought some groceries and a few potted plants before heading home.\nAfter dinner, she browsed online for information about the upcoming technology exhibition. \nAfter that, she made a call. \"Please reserve a ticket for next month's tech exhibition for me.\"\n\"Are you sure?\" the person on the other end replied coolly. \"The last two times you asked me to reserve tickets, you didn't show up. Do you know how many people's lifelong dream is to get one of those tickets? You wasted them thoughtlessly.\"\nThe annual tech exhibition was a major event in the industry, and tickets were not easily obtainable.\nTheir company had a limited number of slots, and many IT elites working for them eagerly vied for the opportunity to attend it.\n\"If I don't show up to the exhibition this time, I will never ask you to reserve a ticket for me ever again,\" Celeste promised.\nThere was silence on the other end before the line disconnected. \nCeleste knew that he'd agreed. The corners of her mouth tugged upward into a smile. What she hadn't said was that she wanted to return to the company.\nThough she was one of the partners of her tech firm, she had stepped back during its early days to focus on marriage and family. Her decision had disrupted their development plans and cost them many opportunities.\nHer colleagues had been both angry and frustrated with her. Over the years, they had rarely been in contact.\nWhile Celeste was eager to return, she knew she had been out of the industry for too long. If she went back unprepared, she was worried she wouldn't be able to keep up with the company's current pace.\nSo, she planned to spend some time familiarizing herself with the industry's latest developments before making a concrete decision.\nFor the next few days, Celeste focused on her work during office hours and spent her evenings tending to her own matters. She didn't reach out to Jordyn or Trevor, and they didn't contact her either.\nCeleste wasn't surprised. For over half a year, her communication with them had been one-sided. They had only passively responded to her efforts.\n\u2026\nMeanwhile, in Andostan, Jordyn had developed the habit of calling Wynn first thing every morning.\nThat day, she called Wynn right after waking up as usual. However, the call didn't last long before she burst into tears.\nWynn had told her some bad news. \"I'm going back to the country soon.\"\nDevastated, Jordyn finished the call and immediately phoned Trevor. \"Dad, did you know about this?\"\nAt his office, Trevor flipped through some documents. \"Yes.\"\n\"When did you find out?\"\n\"It's been a while.\"\n\"Dad, you're so mean\u2026\" Jordyn hugged her pink stuffed pig and cried loudly. \"I don't want Wynn to leave. If she's not here, I don't want to go to school here anymore. I want to go back too!\"\nTrevor's tone remained even. \"It's already being arranged.\"\nJordyn didn't understand. \"W-What do you mean?\"\n\"We're going back next week.\"\nJordyn jumped out of bed in excitement. \"Really?\"\n\"Yes, really,\" Trevor replied.\n\"Then why didn't Wynn tell me just now?\"\n\"It was just finalized. She doesn't know yet.\"\nJordyn was ecstatic. \"Dad, let's keep this a secret from Wynn. We'll surprise her when we go back to the country, okay?\"\n\"Alright.\"\n\"You're the best, Dad! I love you so much!\"\nAfter hanging up, Jordyn was still overjoyed. She sang and danced on her bed.\nAfter a while, she suddenly thought of Celeste. For the past few days, she had been in a great mood because Celeste hadn't called her. In fact, to avoid talking to Celeste, she had deliberately left home early and even turned off her phone or kept it far away from her after school.\nBut after two days, she was worried that Celeste might get angry if she found out. So, she stopped doing that. To her surprise, Celeste hadn't called at all in the days that followed.\nAt first, she thought Celeste had discovered that she was deliberately avoiding her calls. But then she remembered that based on past experiences, that wasn't very likely. If Celeste knew she had done something wrong, she would immediately ask Jordyn to correct her wrongdoing instead of sulking and not calling.\nAfter all, she was the most important person to Celeste. Jordyn knew that Celeste loved her the most, so she didn't think that Celeste would purposely refrain from calling her simply because she was upset.\nAs Jordyn thought about this, she suddenly missed Celeste. It was the first time in days she had thought about Celeste, and she couldn't resist dialing Celeste's number.\nBut just as the call connected, she remembered that while she would get to see Wynn after returning to the country, Celeste would undoubtedly try every possible way to prevent her from meeting Wynn. She wouldn't be able to see Wynn whenever she wanted like she could now.\nThis thought dampened Jordyn's mood.\nIt was midnight in Celeste's time zone. She was already asleep when she was woken by the call. Upon seeing Jordyn's name on the screen, she was about to answer when the call abruptly disconnected.\nAlthough Celeste had written in her divorce agreement that she would relinquish custody of Jordyn, she still felt a sense of responsibility as her mother. Worried that something might have happened, Celeste immediately called back.\nWhen Jordyn saw the incoming call, she turned her head away and refused to answer.\nCeleste became more concerned and quickly called the landline at the villa.\nHannah answered promptly. After hearing Celeste's concerns, she reassured her, \"Ms. Fleming should be fine. She went to bed late last night and woke up late today. When I checked earlier, she was still asleep. I'll go upstairs to take a look and call you back.\"\nFeeling relieved, Celeste replied, \"Thank you.\"\nWhen Hannah went upstairs, Jordyn was already in the bathroom brushing her teeth.\nAfter Hannah relayed Celeste being worried about her, Jordyn lowered her head and lied, \"I accidentally hit the call button.\"\nHannah believed her and didn't doubt what she said. Seeing that Jordyn was still brushing her teeth, she went back downstairs to update Celeste that Jordyn was fine.\nJordyn watched as Hannah left. She huffed and finally felt a bit better.\nAfter hearing Hannah's reassurance, Celeste felt relieved too. Still, having been abruptly woken, she struggled to fall back asleep. She wasn't in great shape the next morning at work.\nThe envelope containing the divorce agreement was completely forgotten by Trevor after the phone call with Wynn.\nOn the day they returned to the country, Trevor packed the last document into his briefcase and ensured that nothing was left behind before heading downstairs.\n\"All set. Let's go.\"\nThe Lincoln stretch limousine departed from the villa and headed to the airport.\n\u2026\nThat night, at around 10:00 pm, the plane carrying Trevor and Jordyn landed on time. By the time they got home, it was nearly midnight. \nJordyn had fallen asleep before they arrived. When Trevor carried her upstairs, he passed the master bedroom and noticed the door was open, but the room was pitch black.\nAfter putting Jordyn on her bed and tucking her in, he returned to the master bedroom and turned on the light. Then, he glanced at the bed and found that it was empty\u2014Celeste wasn't there.\nJust then, the butler, Peter Hawk, came upstairs with his luggage. \nLoosening his tie, Trevor asked, \"Where is she?\"\nPeter replied, \"Mrs. Fleming is on a business trip.\"\nHalf a month ago, Peter hadn't been around when Celeste had left with her suitcase. The other maids told him that Celeste left with a suitcase, so he had assumed she was traveling for work.\nNow that he thought about it, this was unusual. Celeste rarely went on business trips. Even when she did, they typically lasted only two or three days.\nThis time, she had been gone for over two weeks.\n\"Alright,\" Trevor responded indifferently, asking no further questions.\n...\nThe next day, Celeste unexpectedly ran into Trevor at the company. She hadn't known that Trevor and Jordyn had returned to the country. Caught off guard by their sudden encounter, Celeste froze mid-step.\nTrevor also seemed slightly surprised to see her, but he assumed she had just returned from the business trip and didn't think much of it.\nHe passed by her coldly, his face expressionless. As usual, he treated her like she was a stranger and turned to enter the building.\nIn the past, if Celeste had found out that he'd suddenly come back, she would have been overjoyed. Even if she couldn't throw herself into his arms in such a scenario, she would have been very happy and excited. Her eyes would light up as she greeted him. \nEven if Trevor remained indifferent, she would have smiled and wished him good morning enthusiastically.\nBut now, Celeste merely glanced at his handsome face before lowering her eyes. There was no longer any trace of the joy and excitement she once felt.\nTrevor didn't notice any of this and was already walking away.\nWatching his tall and composed figure disappear into the building, Celeste wondered when he had returned. Since he was back, perhaps the matter of their divorce could soon be addressed.\nHaving resolved to go through with the divorce, Celeste didn't dwell on him further. After she returned to her workstation, she quickly immersed herself in her work.\nHalf an hour later, Zeke called her and instructed her to do something. \"Prepare two cups of coffee and take them to Mr. Fleming's office.\"\nIn the early days of her marriage, Celeste had learned that Trevor enjoyed coffee. In hopes of winning his favor, she had spent a great deal of effort studying how to brew it perfectly. Her efforts had paid off. After tasting her coffee, Trevor began to specifically request it, both at home and at the office.\nWhen she first realized he genuinely liked the coffee she made, Celeste had been thrilled. She naively believed it was the first step toward gaining his approval.\nBut she had underestimated his dislike and wariness of her. While he liked her coffee, that was all he liked. His attitude toward her remained cold and distant.\nEven when he wanted her coffee, he would have Zeke reach out to her. Once the coffee was prepared, someone else would pick it up for him. He never gave her the opportunity to approach him herself.\nOnly on rare occasions when no one else was available did she get the chance to deliver it to his office personally.\nThis time, it seemed she was to take the coffee directly to Trevor herself from Zeke's tone. After brewing the coffee, Celeste placed the cups on a tray and carried them to his office.\nThe door to his office was ajar.\nAs she approached and was about to knock on the door politely, she saw Wynn sitting on Trevor's lap. The two of them seemed to be locked in a passionate kiss.\nCeleste stopped in her tracks, her face turning pale.\nUpon seeing her, Wynn shot up from Trevor's lap, looking flustered.\nTrevor's expression darkened, and he questioned in an icy tone, \"Who allowed you to come in?\"\n..."

                  "text": "Every time my husband filed for divorce, he had only one condition: I took all the property, and he only wanted our daughter.\nOn my birthday, I flew across the ocean to surprise them\u2026 and found him having dinner with his true love\u2014my stepsister.\nMy daughter looked at her and said, \u201cMommy.\u201d\nThat day, I finally woke up.\nI drafted the divorce papers, gave up custody, and walked away from it all, building a billion-dollar empire from scratch.\nBut when I returned home one night with a business partner, my ex husband cornered me against the wall.\n\u201cDivorce?\u201d he said, eyes dark. \u201cNot a chance.\u201d\n\nAfter seven years of marriage, my husband, Trevor, fell for another woman\u2014even our daughter wanted her as her new mom.\nI scoffed at the years I\u2019d wasted and handed him the divorce papers. Yet he dropped his usual aloofness, slamming me against the wall,\n\u201cDivorce? Not a chance.\u201d\n***\nWhen Celeste Rodriguez landed at the airport in Andostan, it was already past 9:00 pm.\nIt was her birthday. Her phone buzzed with messages from colleagues and friends\u2014but not a single one from her husband, Trevor Fleming.\nCeleste's smile faded.\nBy the time she reached the villa, it was already past 10:00 pm.\nHannah Lynd, the housekeeper looked startled. \"Mrs. Fleming... what a surprise.\"\n\"Where are Trevor and Jo?\" Celeste asked, handing over her luggage.\n\"Mr. Fleming isn\u2019t back yet. Miss Jordyn\u2019s upstairs playing.\"\nCeleste climbed the stairs. In her room, Jordyn sat in pajamas at her desk, completely absorbed.\n\"Jo?\" Celeste called.\nJordyn turned, her eyes lighting up. In a happy tone, she greeted, \"Mom!\"\nBut then she quickly got back to what she was doing earlier.\nCeleste walked over and hugged her tight, planting a kiss on her cheek. Yet the little one pushed her away and squirmed. \"Mom, I\u2019m busy.\" \nIt had been two months since Celeste last saw Jordyn. She missed her so much that no amount of kisses felt enough. She wanted to talk to Jordyn.\nShe noticed the necklace Jordyn was threading. \"Jo, are you making a seashell necklace?\"\n\"Mm-hm!\" Jordyn perked up visibly. \"Wynn's birthday is in a week. Dad and I picked and polished these ourselves. Pretty, right?\"\nCeleste\u2019s throat tightened. Jordyn didn\u2019t look up, only added brightly, \"Dad even got her a custom gift, tomorrow\u2014\"\nCeleste felt a pang in her chest and couldn't hold back anymore. \"Jo\u2026 Do you remember it's my birthday today?\"\n\"Huh?\" Jordyn glanced up briefly, then quickly looked back down at the string of beads in her hands, She complained, \"Mom, don\u2019t talk, Look, I messed up the bead order\u2014\"\nCeleste stood there in silence for a while, but Jordyn never looked back up. Finally, Celeste pursed her lips and left the room without another word.\nDownstairs, Hannah said, \"I called Mr. Fleming. He said he\u2019s busy tonight and you should rest first.\"\n\"I see.\" Celeste replied softly.\nShe hesitated, then called Trevor. It rang for a while before he answered.\nhis tone was indifferent as usual. \"I'm busy. Let's talk tomorrow\u2014\"\nA woman\u2019s voice chimed in: \"Trevor, who is it?\"\nWynn.\nCeleste gripped the phone tighter.\n\"No one important,\" Trevor answered her.\nBefore Celeste could say anything, Trevor had already hung up.\nCeleste stared at the screen. Two or three months apart, and this was all he had for her.\nAfter so many years of marriage, he\u2019d always been cold. Distant. Impatient. \nShe had got used to chasing after him, calling again, begging for time. Yet tonight, she didn\u2019t bother. \nPerhaps she was just too tired.\n\nThe next morning, Celeste thought it over and decided to call Trevor again.\nThere was a time difference of about 17 or 18 hours between Andostan and their home country. In Andostan, today was her actual birthday.\nShe didn\u2019t just come here for Jordyn. She wanted one thing: a family meal. Her only birthday wish.\nYet, Trevor didn\u2019t answer.\nA long time later, he texted: What\u2019s up?\nShe replied: Lunch today? Just the three of us.\nTrevor answered: Okay. Send the address.\nAlright, she typed back.\nThat was it. No acknowledgment. No \u201cHappy birthday.\u201d She wasn\u2019t surprised. But it still stung.\nAs she headed downstairs, she overheard Jordyn talking with Hannah.\n\"Aren't you happy that Mrs. Fleming is here, sweetie?\" Hannah asked.\n\"Dad and I promised to take Wynn to the beach tomorrow. If Mom comes, it'll be weird. She\u2019s always mean to Wynn.\"\n\"Mrs. Fleming is still your mom, sweetie. That\u2019s hurtful.\"\n\"I know, but Dad and I like Wynn more. Can't Wynn be my mom instead?\"\nCeleste froze.\nShe had raised Jordyn herself most of the time. But over the past two years, the more time Jordyn spent with Trevor, the more attached she became to him. When Trevor came to Andostan to expand his business last year, Jordyn had insisted on coming along.\nCeleste was reluctant and had hoped Jordyn would stay by her side. But she couldn't bear to see Jordyn upset, so she agreed.\nAnd now, Jordyn didn\u2019t even want her as her mom anymore.\nCeleste stood frozen in place, her face pale. To think that she had pushed aside her work to come to Andostan with the intention of spending more time with Jordyn.\nNow, it seemed unnecessary.\nShe walked back to her room, pale and quiet, then repacked the gifts she\u2019d brought.\nLater, Hannah texted: Madame, I took Jordyn out. Let me know if you need anything.\nCeleste sat on the bed, feeling hollow and lost inside. She had abandoned her work and made this trip, only to find no one wanted her here.\nHer arrival was nothing but a joke.\n\nAfter a long while, she left the villa. Aimlessly, she drove around in this foreign yet familiar country.\nBy noon, she remembered she had planned to have lunch with Trevor and Jordyn. As she recalled what she had overheard in the morning, she hesitated about whether to go home and pick up Jordyn. \nThen, a text from Trevor came: Something came up. Lunch\u2019s canceled.\nCeleste stared at it.\nShe should\u2019ve known. Trevor always canceled on her.  His work, friends, and everything else always came before her, his wife.\nOnce, she\u2019d cry. Today, she just felt\u2026 empty.\nCeleste was at an utter loss. She had come all this way excitedly only to be met with indifference from both Trevor and Jordyn.\nAimlessly, she drove around. Eventually, she found herself outside an old favorite restaurant which she and Trevor used to frequent.\nJust as she was about to walk in, she saw them.\nTrevor. Jordyn. Wynn.\nWynn sat next to Jordyn, laughing, feeding the little one the pastries she had taken a bite out of. Jordyn giggled, with her legs swinging around happily. Trevor smiled as he served food to both of them, but his gaze never left Wynn.\nWhat a happy family of three!\nSo this was his \"something came up.\"\nAnd this was the daughter she had carried for ten long months and nearly lost her life to bring into this world.\nCeleste laughed humorlessly. She stood there watching for a long time. Finally, she turned and drove away.\n\nBack at the villa, Celeste drafted the divorce agreement.\nTrevor had been her teenage dream\u2014but he had never truly seen her. If not for that one night and his grandfather Arnold Fleming\u2019s pressure, he never would\u2019ve married her. She thought loving him hard enough would be enough, but seven years proved otherwise.\nFor a long time, she felt lucky to have Jo\u2014her only source of comfort. But now, even Jo didn\u2019t seem to want her.\nThat was it.\nShe was done\u2014with the marriage, the lies, the thankless role of wife and mother. It was time to leave all this behind\u2014and reclaim the promising life she'd given up!\nShe sealed the divorce papers, handed them to Hannah, then grabbed her suitcase and walked out, bound for the airport. On the way, she finally dialed the number she\u2019d been avoiding for months.\nThe line rang once. Twice. A click.\n\u201cHello?\u201d\nShe took a breath, steady and sharp.\u201cThat offer still stand?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d\n...\nAt around 9:00 pm, Trevor and Jordyn returned home.\nJordyn clung to the hem of Trevor's coat and got out of the car sluggishly. Because Celeste was at home, she was reluctant to return that night.\nBut Wynn had said that Celeste came specifically to be with her and Trevor, and if they didn't return, she would be sad. Trevor also said that if they didn't go home that night, Celeste would definitely insist on joining them on their outing to the sea the next day.\nReluctantly, Jordyn agreed to come home.\nStill worried, she muttered gloomily, \"Dad, what if Mom insists on tagging along with us tomorrow?\"\n\"She won't,\" Trevor replied confidently.\nIn all the years they'd been married, Celeste had always tried to find ways to spend more time with him. But she was also sensible. As long as he made his stance clear, she wouldn't dare make him upset.\nIn Jordyn's memory, Celeste always listened to Trevor. Since he said she wouldn't, she felt reassured. As a result, her mood lifted. She made her way into the villa cheerfully and told Hannah she wanted to take a bath.\n\"Sure, sure,\" Hannah replied to Jordyn. Then, she remembered Celeste's instructions and handed an envelope to Trevor. \"Mr. Fleming, this is from Mrs. Fleming. She asked me to give it to you.\"\nTrevor took the envelope and asked casually, \"Where is she?\"\n\"Mrs. Fleming packed up and went back to the country this afternoon. Didn't you know?\" Hannah responded.\nTrevor paused mid-step as he was heading upstairs. He turned back, feeling a little surprised. \"Has she gone back?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nWhy had Celeste suddenly come to Andostan? Trevor hadn't given her a chance to tell him about it. He hadn't cared to ask either. Upon learning she'd left, he didn't dwell on it.\nJordyn was a little surprised too. When she heard the news, she felt a small twinge of disappointment. She'd been thinking that even if Celeste didn't join them for the outing tomorrow, it might be nice to have her around at home in the evening.\nPolishing the seashells made her hands hurt\u2014she had been counting on Celeste's help in finishing the necklace.\nThough it had been months since Trevor and Celeste had seen each other, she had made the effort to visit but only to leave without seeing him in person. Hannah recalled Celeste's grim expression as she left and thought that things felt a little off.\nShe couldn't help but say, \"Mr. Fleming, Mrs. Fleming looked upset when she left. She seemed angry.\"\nHannah had assumed Celeste's sudden departure was due to an urgent matter. Upon realizing Trevor hadn't known she'd left, she began to feel something was amiss.\n\"Angry?\" Trevor repeated in his mind. \nIn his presence, Celeste had always been patient and accommodating. So, she could get angry too? This was new.\nTrevor smiled faintly and responded to Hannah perfunctorily before heading upstairs.\nBack in the bedroom, he was about to open the envelope Celeste had left when Wynn called. After answering the call, he tossed the envelope aside and walked out the door.\nA short while later, the envelope slipped off the bed onto the floor.\nThat night, Trevor didn't return home.\nThe next day, Hannah noticed the envelope on the floor when she was cleaning. Recognizing it as the one Celeste had asked her to hand over, she assumed Trevor had already seen it and placed it in a nearby drawer.\n\u2026\nRight after getting off the plane, Celeste went home and began packing her belongings. She had accumulated quite a few things in the house since she'd been living there for six years, after all. But she only took a few sets of clothes, two sets of daily necessities, and some books that were related to her field of study back in college.\nAfter their marriage, Trevor had been depositing money for her and Jordyn into two separate accounts every month. One account was hers, and the other was Jordyn's.\nHowever, Celeste was used to spending her own money only. She had never touched the money in Jordyn's account. Because she loved Trevor, whenever she went shopping and saw clothes, shoes, cufflinks, or ties that suited him, she couldn't help but buy them.\nIn contrast, she didn't have many expenses on a daily basis because all she did was go to work. Her heart and mind were always focused on Trevor and Jordyn. She wanted to give them the best of everything.\nMost of the money Trevor deposited into her bank account was spent on him and Jordyn.\nGiven this spending pattern, there shouldn't have been much money left in Celeste's account. But over the past year, her opportunities to buy things for Trevor and Jordyn had decreased significantly because they were in Andostan.\nNow, there were over three million dollars in her account. That amount might not matter to Trevor, but to her, it was no small sum. And since it was her money, Celeste didn't hesitate to transfer it out.\nShe left both cards behind, dragged her suitcase out the door, and didn't look back.\nCeleste had an apartment near her workplace, which was a little over 1,100 square feet. She'd bought it four years ago to support a friend who had been struggling to meet their sales targets. She had never lived there before.\nNow, the apartment came in handy. She had it cleaned regularly, so it wasn't dirty. After a quick tidy-up, it was ready to move in.\nAfter a long day, Celeste washed up and went to bed around 10:00 pm.\n\u2026\nThe shrill sound of an alarm jolted Celeste awake. Startled, her mind went blank for a moment.\nWhen she came to her senses, she realized that while it was 1:00 am here, it was 7:00 am in Andostan, where Trevor and Jordyn were. This was their usual breakfast time.\nEver since Jordyn had gone to live with Trevor in Andostan, Celeste had developed the habit of calling her at this time every day. As she was always exhausted from work and was used to going to bed early, she had set this alarm to ensure she wouldn't miss the call.\nAt first, Jordyn hadn't adapted well to living in Andostan and had missed her terribly. She had called Celeste constantly. But as time went on, the calls that used to be full of yearning and dependence had grown perfunctory and impatient.\nThe alarm was no longer necessary. She just hadn't been able to let go.\nSmiling bitterly, Celeste deleted the alarm and turned off her phone before going back to sleep.\n\u2026\nMeanwhile, Trevor and Jordyn were nearly done with breakfast. Though he knew Celeste usually called Jordyn at this time, he wasn't always home and hadn't paid much attention to the routine.\nHe noticed that Celeste hadn't called that day. The fact registered in his mind, but he didn't care. After finishing breakfast, he went upstairs to change.\nJordyn, finding Celeste increasingly annoying, had grown less fond of their calls. Upon realizing that Celeste hadn't called yet, she figured something must have come up.\nShe grabbed her backpack and bolted for the door.\nHannah hurried after her. \"Ms. Fleming, it's still early. There's no rush!\"\nJordyn ignored her and ran to the car happily. She was thrilled that Celeste hadn't called on time that day. If she stayed home, she might still have to talk to Celeste later. Well, she didn't want that!\n\u2026\nAfter getting married to Trevor, Celeste had joined Fleming Group for his sake. Now that she was planning to divorce him, she saw no reason to stay.\nThe next morning, Celeste handed her resignation letter to Zeke Jackson after arriving at the office.\nZeke was one of Trevor's personal secretaries. When he saw Celeste's resignation letter, he was extremely surprised.\nHe was one of the few in the company who knew about the relationship between Celeste and Trevor.\nAnyone familiar with Trevor knew that he didn't love Celeste. So, he had been cold to her and rarely went home after their marriage.\nTo get closer to and win over Trevor, Celeste had chosen to work at Fleming Group.\nHer initial goal was to become his personal secretary, but Trevor refused vehemently. Even when Arnold stepped in, he couldn't get Trevor to agree. In the end, Celeste had to settle for a position in the secretarial team, becoming one of Trevor's many ordinary secretaries.\nAt first, Zeke had worried that Celeste's presence in the secretarial team would create chaos. But to his surprise, she didn't bring them any trouble. Although Celeste used her position to get closer to Trevor, she was mindful of her timing and never overstepped her boundaries. \nOn the contrary, she worked diligently and performed exceptionally well, hoping to gain Trevor's respect. Whether during her pregnancy, childbirth, or any other time, she strictly adhered to company policies and never sought special treatment.\nOver the years, Celeste rose to become the head of the secretarial team. Zeke had observed her feelings for Trevor from the sidelines all the while. To be honest, he had never imagined she would resign one day. He felt skeptical about her willingly giving up her position.\nSomething must have happened between Celeste and Trevor for her to resign now. Zeke understood that this was something he wasn't privy to\u2014it must be something significant enough for Trevor to have ordered her to resign.\nWhile he found it a pity, Zeke maintained a professional tone. \"I acknowledge that I've received your resignation letter. I'll arrange for someone to take over your duties as soon as possible.\"\n\"Alright.\" Celeste nodded and returned to her workstation.\nAfter working for a while, Zeke started an online meeting with Trevor to report on company matters. As the conversation neared its end, he suddenly remembered Celeste's resignation. \n\"Oh, Mr. Fleming, there's one more thing\u2014\"\nAlthough Zeke had told Celeste he would quickly arrange for someone to take over her position, he wanted to gauge Trevor's thoughts on the matter first. If Trevor wanted Celeste out immediately, he would make the arrangements right away.\nBut as the words left his mouth, he remembered that when Celeste first joined the company, Trevor had explicitly stated that all matters regarding her employment should be handled per company regulations. He made it clear that there was no need to report anything to him since he wouldn't concern himself with her.\nAnd indeed, over the years, Trevor had never actively inquired about Celeste's work at the company.\nEven when he encountered her at work, he treated her like she was a complete stranger.\nWhen Celeste was set to be promoted a couple of years ago, the team had hesitated. Everyone was aware of Trevor's dislike for her. They had even brought it up with him to gauge his opinion back then.\nTrevor had frowned in annoyance and reiterated that he wouldn't interfere and that they should handle it according to company policy. He had emphasized that they shouldn't bring up Celeste's matters with him again.\nSeeing Zeke's hesitation, Trevor frowned. \"What is it?\"\nZeke snapped out of his thoughts and quickly replied, \"Oh, it's nothing.\"\nSince Trevor was already aware of Celeste's resignation but hadn't brought it up, it was clear that this matter wasn't important to him. So, Zeke decided to proceed as usual and handle the matter according to company regulations.\nWith that resolved, Trevor ended the call.\n\u2026\n\"What are you thinking about?\" At noon, a colleague patted Celeste on the shoulder.\nCeleste came back to her senses and smiled, shaking her head. \"Nothing.\"\n\"Don't you need to call your daughter today?\"\n\"No, not today.\"\nTypically, she called Jordyn twice a day\u2014once at 1:00 am and once at around 12:00 pm.\nHer colleagues at work were aware of this habit. What they didn't know was her daughter was the child she had with the company's CEO.\nAfter work, Celeste went to the supermarket. She bought some groceries and a few potted plants before heading home.\nAfter dinner, she browsed online for information about the upcoming technology exhibition. \nAfter that, she made a call. \"Please reserve a ticket for next month's tech exhibition for me.\"\n\"Are you sure?\" the person on the other end replied coolly. \"The last two times you asked me to reserve tickets, you didn't show up. Do you know how many people's lifelong dream is to get one of those tickets? You wasted them thoughtlessly.\"\nThe annual tech exhibition was a major event in the industry, and tickets were not easily obtainable.\nTheir company had a limited number of slots, and many IT elites working for them eagerly vied for the opportunity to attend it.\n\"If I don't show up to the exhibition this time, I will never ask you to reserve a ticket for me ever again,\" Celeste promised.\nThere was silence on the other end before the line disconnected. \nCeleste knew that he'd agreed. The corners of her mouth tugged upward into a smile. What she hadn't said was that she wanted to return to the company.\nThough she was one of the partners of her tech firm, she had stepped back during its early days to focus on marriage and family. Her decision had disrupted their development plans and cost them many opportunities.\nHer colleagues had been both angry and frustrated with her. Over the years, they had rarely been in contact.\nWhile Celeste was eager to return, she knew she had been out of the industry for too long. If she went back unprepared, she was worried she wouldn't be able to keep up with the company's current pace.\nSo, she planned to spend some time familiarizing herself with the industry's latest developments before making a concrete decision.\nFor the next few days, Celeste focused on her work during office hours and spent her evenings tending to her own matters. She didn't reach out to Jordyn or Trevor, and they didn't contact her either.\nCeleste wasn't surprised. For over half a year, her communication with them had been one-sided. They had only passively responded to her efforts.\n\u2026\nMeanwhile, in Andostan, Jordyn had developed the habit of calling Wynn first thing every morning.\nThat day, she called Wynn right after waking up as usual. However, the call didn't last long before she burst into tears.\nWynn had told her some bad news. \"I'm going back to the country soon.\"\nDevastated, Jordyn finished the call and immediately phoned Trevor. \"Dad, did you know about this?\"\nAt his office, Trevor flipped through some documents. \"Yes.\"\n\"When did you find out?\"\n\"It's been a while.\"\n\"Dad, you're so mean\u2026\" Jordyn hugged her pink stuffed pig and cried loudly. \"I don't want Wynn to leave. If she's not here, I don't want to go to school here anymore. I want to go back too!\"\nTrevor's tone remained even. \"It's already being arranged.\"\nJordyn didn't understand. \"W-What do you mean?\"\n\"We're going back next week.\"\nJordyn jumped out of bed in excitement. \"Really?\"\n\"Yes, really,\" Trevor replied.\n\"Then why didn't Wynn tell me just now?\"\n\"It was just finalized. She doesn't know yet.\"\nJordyn was ecstatic. \"Dad, let's keep this a secret from Wynn. We'll surprise her when we go back to the country, okay?\"\n\"Alright.\"\n\"You're the best, Dad! I love you so much!\"\nAfter hanging up, Jordyn was still overjoyed. She sang and danced on her bed.\nAfter a while, she suddenly thought of Celeste. For the past few days, she had been in a great mood because Celeste hadn't called her. In fact, to avoid talking to Celeste, she had deliberately left home early and even turned off her phone or kept it far away from her after school.\nBut after two days, she was worried that Celeste might get angry if she found out. So, she stopped doing that. To her surprise, Celeste hadn't called at all in the days that followed.\nAt first, she thought Celeste had discovered that she was deliberately avoiding her calls. But then she remembered that based on past experiences, that wasn't very likely. If Celeste knew she had done something wrong, she would immediately ask Jordyn to correct her wrongdoing instead of sulking and not calling.\nAfter all, she was the most important person to Celeste. Jordyn knew that Celeste loved her the most, so she didn't think that Celeste would purposely refrain from calling her simply because she was upset.\nAs Jordyn thought about this, she suddenly missed Celeste. It was the first time in days she had thought about Celeste, and she couldn't resist dialing Celeste's number.\nBut just as the call connected, she remembered that while she would get to see Wynn after returning to the country, Celeste would undoubtedly try every possible way to prevent her from meeting Wynn. She wouldn't be able to see Wynn whenever she wanted like she could now.\nThis thought dampened Jordyn's mood.\nIt was midnight in Celeste's time zone. She was already asleep when she was woken by the call. Upon seeing Jordyn's name on the screen, she was about to answer when the call abruptly disconnected.\nAlthough Celeste had written in her divorce agreement that she would relinquish custody of Jordyn, she still felt a sense of responsibility as her mother. Worried that something might have happened, Celeste immediately called back.\nWhen Jordyn saw the incoming call, she turned her head away and refused to answer.\nCeleste became more concerned and quickly called the landline at the villa.\nHannah answered promptly. After hearing Celeste's concerns, she reassured her, \"Ms. Fleming should be fine. She went to bed late last night and woke up late today. When I checked earlier, she was still asleep. I'll go upstairs to take a look and call you back.\"\nFeeling relieved, Celeste replied, \"Thank you.\"\nWhen Hannah went upstairs, Jordyn was already in the bathroom brushing her teeth.\nAfter Hannah relayed Celeste being worried about her, Jordyn lowered her head and lied, \"I accidentally hit the call button.\"\nHannah believed her and didn't doubt what she said. Seeing that Jordyn was still brushing her teeth, she went back downstairs to update Celeste that Jordyn was fine.\nJordyn watched as Hannah left. She huffed and finally felt a bit better.\nAfter hearing Hannah's reassurance, Celeste felt relieved too. Still, having been abruptly woken, she struggled to fall back asleep. She wasn't in great shape the next morning at work.\nThe envelope containing the divorce agreement was completely forgotten by Trevor after the phone call with Wynn.\nOn the day they returned to the country, Trevor packed the last document into his briefcase and ensured that nothing was left behind before heading downstairs.\n\"All set. Let's go.\"\nThe Lincoln stretch limousine departed from the villa and headed to the airport.\n\u2026\nThat night, at around 10:00 pm, the plane carrying Trevor and Jordyn landed on time. By the time they got home, it was nearly midnight. \nJordyn had fallen asleep before they arrived. When Trevor carried her upstairs, he passed the master bedroom and noticed the door was open, but the room was pitch black.\nAfter putting Jordyn on her bed and tucking her in, he returned to the master bedroom and turned on the light. Then, he glanced at the bed and found that it was empty\u2014Celeste wasn't there.\nJust then, the butler, Peter Hawk, came upstairs with his luggage. \nLoosening his tie, Trevor asked, \"Where is she?\"\nPeter replied, \"Mrs. Fleming is on a business trip.\"\nHalf a month ago, Peter hadn't been around when Celeste had left with her suitcase. The other maids told him that Celeste left with a suitcase, so he had assumed she was traveling for work.\nNow that he thought about it, this was unusual. Celeste rarely went on business trips. Even when she did, they typically lasted only two or three days.\nThis time, she had been gone for over two weeks.\n\"Alright,\" Trevor responded indifferently, asking no further questions.\n...\nThe next day, Celeste unexpectedly ran into Trevor at the company. She hadn't known that Trevor and Jordyn had returned to the country. Caught off guard by their sudden encounter, Celeste froze mid-step.\nTrevor also seemed slightly surprised to see her, but he assumed she had just returned from the business trip and didn't think much of it.\nHe passed by her coldly, his face expressionless. As usual, he treated her like she was a stranger and turned to enter the building.\nIn the past, if Celeste had found out that he'd suddenly come back, she would have been overjoyed. Even if she couldn't throw herself into his arms in such a scenario, she would have been very happy and excited. Her eyes would light up as she greeted him. \nEven if Trevor remained indifferent, she would have smiled and wished him good morning enthusiastically.\nBut now, Celeste merely glanced at his handsome face before lowering her eyes. There was no longer any trace of the joy and excitement she once felt.\nTrevor didn't notice any of this and was already walking away.\nWatching his tall and composed figure disappear into the building, Celeste wondered when he had returned. Since he was back, perhaps the matter of their divorce could soon be addressed.\nHaving resolved to go through with the divorce, Celeste didn't dwell on him further. After she returned to her workstation, she quickly immersed herself in her work.\nHalf an hour later, Zeke called her and instructed her to do something. \"Prepare two cups of coffee and take them to Mr. Fleming's office.\"\nIn the early days of her marriage, Celeste had learned that Trevor enjoyed coffee. In hopes of winning his favor, she had spent a great deal of effort studying how to brew it perfectly. Her efforts had paid off. After tasting her coffee, Trevor began to specifically request it, both at home and at the office.\nWhen she first realized he genuinely liked the coffee she made, Celeste had been thrilled. She naively believed it was the first step toward gaining his approval.\nBut she had underestimated his dislike and wariness of her. While he liked her coffee, that was all he liked. His attitude toward her remained cold and distant.\nEven when he wanted her coffee, he would have Zeke reach out to her. Once the coffee was prepared, someone else would pick it up for him. He never gave her the opportunity to approach him herself.\nOnly on rare occasions when no one else was available did she get the chance to deliver it to his office personally.\nThis time, it seemed she was to take the coffee directly to Trevor herself from Zeke's tone. After brewing the coffee, Celeste placed the cups on a tray and carried them to his office.\nThe door to his office was ajar.\nAs she approached and was about to knock on the door politely, she saw Wynn sitting on Trevor's lap. The two of them seemed to be locked in a passionate kiss.\nCeleste stopped in her tracks, her face turning pale.\nUpon seeing her, Wynn shot up from Trevor's lap, looking flustered.\nTrevor's expression darkened, and he questioned in an icy tone, \"Who allowed you to come in?\"\n..."

                  "text": "If your husband stayed cold around you, then his passion might have found someone else.\nCeleste looked into the restaurant - her husband wrapped his arms around his first love dotingly, while her daughter was giggling besides...she finally decided to let go.\nThe cheating husband, along with the daughter calling another woman \"mom\"\u2014she would throw them both out of her life!\n\nAfter seven years of marriage, my husband, Trevor, fell for another woman\u2014even our daughter wanted her as her new mom.\nI scoffed at the years I\u2019d wasted and handed him the divorce papers. Yet he dropped his usual aloofness, slamming me against the wall,\n\u201cDivorce? Not a chance.\u201d\n***\nWhen Celeste Rodriguez landed at the airport in Andostan, it was already past 9:00 pm.\nIt was her birthday. Her phone buzzed with messages from colleagues and friends\u2014but not a single one from her husband, Trevor Fleming.\nCeleste's smile faded.\nBy the time she reached the villa, it was already past 10:00 pm.\nHannah Lynd, the housekeeper looked startled. \"Mrs. Fleming... what a surprise.\"\n\"Where are Trevor and Jo?\" Celeste asked, handing over her luggage.\n\"Mr. Fleming isn\u2019t back yet. Miss Jordyn\u2019s upstairs playing.\"\nCeleste climbed the stairs. In her room, Jordyn sat in pajamas at her desk, completely absorbed.\n\"Jo?\" Celeste called.\nJordyn turned, her eyes lighting up. In a happy tone, she greeted, \"Mom!\"\nBut then she quickly got back to what she was doing earlier.\nCeleste walked over and hugged her tight, planting a kiss on her cheek. Yet the little one pushed her away and squirmed. \"Mom, I\u2019m busy.\" \nIt had been two months since Celeste last saw Jordyn. She missed her so much that no amount of kisses felt enough. She wanted to talk to Jordyn.\nShe noticed the necklace Jordyn was threading. \"Jo, are you making a seashell necklace?\"\n\"Mm-hm!\" Jordyn perked up visibly. \"Wynn's birthday is in a week. Dad and I picked and polished these ourselves. Pretty, right?\"\nCeleste\u2019s throat tightened. Jordyn didn\u2019t look up, only added brightly, \"Dad even got her a custom gift, tomorrow\u2014\"\nCeleste felt a pang in her chest and couldn't hold back anymore. \"Jo\u2026 Do you remember it's my birthday today?\"\n\"Huh?\" Jordyn glanced up briefly, then quickly looked back down at the string of beads in her hands, She complained, \"Mom, don\u2019t talk, Look, I messed up the bead order\u2014\"\nCeleste stood there in silence for a while, but Jordyn never looked back up. Finally, Celeste pursed her lips and left the room without another word.\nDownstairs, Hannah said, \"I called Mr. Fleming. He said he\u2019s busy tonight and you should rest first.\"\n\"I see.\" Celeste replied softly.\nShe hesitated, then called Trevor. It rang for a while before he answered.\nhis tone was indifferent as usual. \"I'm busy. Let's talk tomorrow\u2014\"\nA woman\u2019s voice chimed in: \"Trevor, who is it?\"\nWynn.\nCeleste gripped the phone tighter.\n\"No one important,\" Trevor answered her.\nBefore Celeste could say anything, Trevor had already hung up.\nCeleste stared at the screen. Two or three months apart, and this was all he had for her.\nAfter so many years of marriage, he\u2019d always been cold. Distant. Impatient. \nShe had got used to chasing after him, calling again, begging for time. Yet tonight, she didn\u2019t bother. \nPerhaps she was just too tired.\n\nThe next morning, Celeste thought it over and decided to call Trevor again.\nThere was a time difference of about 17 or 18 hours between Andostan and their home country. In Andostan, today was her actual birthday.\nShe didn\u2019t just come here for Jordyn. She wanted one thing: a family meal. Her only birthday wish.\nYet, Trevor didn\u2019t answer.\nA long time later, he texted: What\u2019s up?\nShe replied: Lunch today? Just the three of us.\nTrevor answered: Okay. Send the address.\nAlright, she typed back.\nThat was it. No acknowledgment. No \u201cHappy birthday.\u201d She wasn\u2019t surprised. But it still stung.\nAs she headed downstairs, she overheard Jordyn talking with Hannah.\n\"Aren't you happy that Mrs. Fleming is here, sweetie?\" Hannah asked.\n\"Dad and I promised to take Wynn to the beach tomorrow. If Mom comes, it'll be weird. She\u2019s always mean to Wynn.\"\n\"Mrs. Fleming is still your mom, sweetie. That\u2019s hurtful.\"\n\"I know, but Dad and I like Wynn more. Can't Wynn be my mom instead?\"\nCeleste froze.\nShe had raised Jordyn herself most of the time. But over the past two years, the more time Jordyn spent with Trevor, the more attached she became to him. When Trevor came to Andostan to expand his business last year, Jordyn had insisted on coming along.\nCeleste was reluctant and had hoped Jordyn would stay by her side. But she couldn't bear to see Jordyn upset, so she agreed.\nAnd now, Jordyn didn\u2019t even want her as her mom anymore.\nCeleste stood frozen in place, her face pale. To think that she had pushed aside her work to come to Andostan with the intention of spending more time with Jordyn.\nNow, it seemed unnecessary.\nShe walked back to her room, pale and quiet, then repacked the gifts she\u2019d brought.\nLater, Hannah texted: Madame, I took Jordyn out. Let me know if you need anything.\nCeleste sat on the bed, feeling hollow and lost inside. She had abandoned her work and made this trip, only to find no one wanted her here.\nHer arrival was nothing but a joke.\n\nAfter a long while, she left the villa. Aimlessly, she drove around in this foreign yet familiar country.\nBy noon, she remembered she had planned to have lunch with Trevor and Jordyn. As she recalled what she had overheard in the morning, she hesitated about whether to go home and pick up Jordyn. \nThen, a text from Trevor came: Something came up. Lunch\u2019s canceled.\nCeleste stared at it.\nShe should\u2019ve known. Trevor always canceled on her.  His work, friends, and everything else always came before her, his wife.\nOnce, she\u2019d cry. Today, she just felt\u2026 empty.\nCeleste was at an utter loss. She had come all this way excitedly only to be met with indifference from both Trevor and Jordyn.\nAimlessly, she drove around. Eventually, she found herself outside an old favorite restaurant which she and Trevor used to frequent.\nJust as she was about to walk in, she saw them.\nTrevor. Jordyn. Wynn.\nWynn sat next to Jordyn, laughing, feeding the little one the pastries she had taken a bite out of. Jordyn giggled, with her legs swinging around happily. Trevor smiled as he served food to both of them, but his gaze never left Wynn.\nWhat a happy family of three!\nSo this was his \"something came up.\"\nAnd this was the daughter she had carried for ten long months and nearly lost her life to bring into this world.\nCeleste laughed humorlessly. She stood there watching for a long time. Finally, she turned and drove away.\n\nBack at the villa, Celeste drafted the divorce agreement.\nTrevor had been her teenage dream\u2014but he had never truly seen her. If not for that one night and his grandfather Arnold Fleming\u2019s pressure, he never would\u2019ve married her. She thought loving him hard enough would be enough, but seven years proved otherwise.\nFor a long time, she felt lucky to have Jo\u2014her only source of comfort. But now, even Jo didn\u2019t seem to want her.\nThat was it.\nShe was done\u2014with the marriage, the lies, the thankless role of wife and mother. It was time to leave all this behind\u2014and reclaim the promising life she'd given up!\nShe sealed the divorce papers, handed them to Hannah, then grabbed her suitcase and walked out, bound for the airport. On the way, she finally dialed the number she\u2019d been avoiding for months.\nThe line rang once. Twice. A click.\n\u201cHello?\u201d\nShe took a breath, steady and sharp.\u201cThat offer still stand?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d\n...\nAt around 9:00 pm, Trevor and Jordyn returned home.\nJordyn clung to the hem of Trevor's coat and got out of the car sluggishly. Because Celeste was at home, she was reluctant to return that night.\nBut Wynn had said that Celeste came specifically to be with her and Trevor, and if they didn't return, she would be sad. Trevor also said that if they didn't go home that night, Celeste would definitely insist on joining them on their outing to the sea the next day.\nReluctantly, Jordyn agreed to come home.\nStill worried, she muttered gloomily, \"Dad, what if Mom insists on tagging along with us tomorrow?\"\n\"She won't,\" Trevor replied confidently.\nIn all the years they'd been married, Celeste had always tried to find ways to spend more time with him. But she was also sensible. As long as he made his stance clear, she wouldn't dare make him upset.\nIn Jordyn's memory, Celeste always listened to Trevor. Since he said she wouldn't, she felt reassured. As a result, her mood lifted. She made her way into the villa cheerfully and told Hannah she wanted to take a bath.\n\"Sure, sure,\" Hannah replied to Jordyn. Then, she remembered Celeste's instructions and handed an envelope to Trevor. \"Mr. Fleming, this is from Mrs. Fleming. She asked me to give it to you.\"\nTrevor took the envelope and asked casually, \"Where is she?\"\n\"Mrs. Fleming packed up and went back to the country this afternoon. Didn't you know?\" Hannah responded.\nTrevor paused mid-step as he was heading upstairs. He turned back, feeling a little surprised. \"Has she gone back?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nWhy had Celeste suddenly come to Andostan? Trevor hadn't given her a chance to tell him about it. He hadn't cared to ask either. Upon learning she'd left, he didn't dwell on it.\nJordyn was a little surprised too. When she heard the news, she felt a small twinge of disappointment. She'd been thinking that even if Celeste didn't join them for the outing tomorrow, it might be nice to have her around at home in the evening.\nPolishing the seashells made her hands hurt\u2014she had been counting on Celeste's help in finishing the necklace.\nThough it had been months since Trevor and Celeste had seen each other, she had made the effort to visit but only to leave without seeing him in person. Hannah recalled Celeste's grim expression as she left and thought that things felt a little off.\nShe couldn't help but say, \"Mr. Fleming, Mrs. Fleming looked upset when she left. She seemed angry.\"\nHannah had assumed Celeste's sudden departure was due to an urgent matter. Upon realizing Trevor hadn't known she'd left, she began to feel something was amiss.\n\"Angry?\" Trevor repeated in his mind. \nIn his presence, Celeste had always been patient and accommodating. So, she could get angry too? This was new.\nTrevor smiled faintly and responded to Hannah perfunctorily before heading upstairs.\nBack in the bedroom, he was about to open the envelope Celeste had left when Wynn called. After answering the call, he tossed the envelope aside and walked out the door.\nA short while later, the envelope slipped off the bed onto the floor.\nThat night, Trevor didn't return home.\nThe next day, Hannah noticed the envelope on the floor when she was cleaning. Recognizing it as the one Celeste had asked her to hand over, she assumed Trevor had already seen it and placed it in a nearby drawer.\n\u2026\nRight after getting off the plane, Celeste went home and began packing her belongings. She had accumulated quite a few things in the house since she'd been living there for six years, after all. But she only took a few sets of clothes, two sets of daily necessities, and some books that were related to her field of study back in college.\nAfter their marriage, Trevor had been depositing money for her and Jordyn into two separate accounts every month. One account was hers, and the other was Jordyn's.\nHowever, Celeste was used to spending her own money only. She had never touched the money in Jordyn's account. Because she loved Trevor, whenever she went shopping and saw clothes, shoes, cufflinks, or ties that suited him, she couldn't help but buy them.\nIn contrast, she didn't have many expenses on a daily basis because all she did was go to work. Her heart and mind were always focused on Trevor and Jordyn. She wanted to give them the best of everything.\nMost of the money Trevor deposited into her bank account was spent on him and Jordyn.\nGiven this spending pattern, there shouldn't have been much money left in Celeste's account. But over the past year, her opportunities to buy things for Trevor and Jordyn had decreased significantly because they were in Andostan.\nNow, there were over three million dollars in her account. That amount might not matter to Trevor, but to her, it was no small sum. And since it was her money, Celeste didn't hesitate to transfer it out.\nShe left both cards behind, dragged her suitcase out the door, and didn't look back.\nCeleste had an apartment near her workplace, which was a little over 1,100 square feet. She'd bought it four years ago to support a friend who had been struggling to meet their sales targets. She had never lived there before.\nNow, the apartment came in handy. She had it cleaned regularly, so it wasn't dirty. After a quick tidy-up, it was ready to move in.\nAfter a long day, Celeste washed up and went to bed around 10:00 pm.\n\u2026\nThe shrill sound of an alarm jolted Celeste awake. Startled, her mind went blank for a moment.\nWhen she came to her senses, she realized that while it was 1:00 am here, it was 7:00 am in Andostan, where Trevor and Jordyn were. This was their usual breakfast time.\nEver since Jordyn had gone to live with Trevor in Andostan, Celeste had developed the habit of calling her at this time every day. As she was always exhausted from work and was used to going to bed early, she had set this alarm to ensure she wouldn't miss the call.\nAt first, Jordyn hadn't adapted well to living in Andostan and had missed her terribly. She had called Celeste constantly. But as time went on, the calls that used to be full of yearning and dependence had grown perfunctory and impatient.\nThe alarm was no longer necessary. She just hadn't been able to let go.\nSmiling bitterly, Celeste deleted the alarm and turned off her phone before going back to sleep.\n\u2026\nMeanwhile, Trevor and Jordyn were nearly done with breakfast. Though he knew Celeste usually called Jordyn at this time, he wasn't always home and hadn't paid much attention to the routine.\nHe noticed that Celeste hadn't called that day. The fact registered in his mind, but he didn't care. After finishing breakfast, he went upstairs to change.\nJordyn, finding Celeste increasingly annoying, had grown less fond of their calls. Upon realizing that Celeste hadn't called yet, she figured something must have come up.\nShe grabbed her backpack and bolted for the door.\nHannah hurried after her. \"Ms. Fleming, it's still early. There's no rush!\"\nJordyn ignored her and ran to the car happily. She was thrilled that Celeste hadn't called on time that day. If she stayed home, she might still have to talk to Celeste later. Well, she didn't want that!\n\u2026\nAfter getting married to Trevor, Celeste had joined Fleming Group for his sake. Now that she was planning to divorce him, she saw no reason to stay.\nThe next morning, Celeste handed her resignation letter to Zeke Jackson after arriving at the office.\nZeke was one of Trevor's personal secretaries. When he saw Celeste's resignation letter, he was extremely surprised.\nHe was one of the few in the company who knew about the relationship between Celeste and Trevor.\nAnyone familiar with Trevor knew that he didn't love Celeste. So, he had been cold to her and rarely went home after their marriage.\nTo get closer to and win over Trevor, Celeste had chosen to work at Fleming Group.\nHer initial goal was to become his personal secretary, but Trevor refused vehemently. Even when Arnold stepped in, he couldn't get Trevor to agree. In the end, Celeste had to settle for a position in the secretarial team, becoming one of Trevor's many ordinary secretaries.\nAt first, Zeke had worried that Celeste's presence in the secretarial team would create chaos. But to his surprise, she didn't bring them any trouble. Although Celeste used her position to get closer to Trevor, she was mindful of her timing and never overstepped her boundaries. \nOn the contrary, she worked diligently and performed exceptionally well, hoping to gain Trevor's respect. Whether during her pregnancy, childbirth, or any other time, she strictly adhered to company policies and never sought special treatment.\nOver the years, Celeste rose to become the head of the secretarial team. Zeke had observed her feelings for Trevor from the sidelines all the while. To be honest, he had never imagined she would resign one day. He felt skeptical about her willingly giving up her position.\nSomething must have happened between Celeste and Trevor for her to resign now. Zeke understood that this was something he wasn't privy to\u2014it must be something significant enough for Trevor to have ordered her to resign.\nWhile he found it a pity, Zeke maintained a professional tone. \"I acknowledge that I've received your resignation letter. I'll arrange for someone to take over your duties as soon as possible.\"\n\"Alright.\" Celeste nodded and returned to her workstation.\nAfter working for a while, Zeke started an online meeting with Trevor to report on company matters. As the conversation neared its end, he suddenly remembered Celeste's resignation. \n\"Oh, Mr. Fleming, there's one more thing\u2014\"\nAlthough Zeke had told Celeste he would quickly arrange for someone to take over her position, he wanted to gauge Trevor's thoughts on the matter first. If Trevor wanted Celeste out immediately, he would make the arrangements right away.\nBut as the words left his mouth, he remembered that when Celeste first joined the company, Trevor had explicitly stated that all matters regarding her employment should be handled per company regulations. He made it clear that there was no need to report anything to him since he wouldn't concern himself with her.\nAnd indeed, over the years, Trevor had never actively inquired about Celeste's work at the company.\nEven when he encountered her at work, he treated her like she was a complete stranger.\nWhen Celeste was set to be promoted a couple of years ago, the team had hesitated. Everyone was aware of Trevor's dislike for her. They had even brought it up with him to gauge his opinion back then.\nTrevor had frowned in annoyance and reiterated that he wouldn't interfere and that they should handle it according to company policy. He had emphasized that they shouldn't bring up Celeste's matters with him again.\nSeeing Zeke's hesitation, Trevor frowned. \"What is it?\"\nZeke snapped out of his thoughts and quickly replied, \"Oh, it's nothing.\"\nSince Trevor was already aware of Celeste's resignation but hadn't brought it up, it was clear that this matter wasn't important to him. So, Zeke decided to proceed as usual and handle the matter according to company regulations.\nWith that resolved, Trevor ended the call.\n\u2026\n\"What are you thinking about?\" At noon, a colleague patted Celeste on the shoulder.\nCeleste came back to her senses and smiled, shaking her head. \"Nothing.\"\n\"Don't you need to call your daughter today?\"\n\"No, not today.\"\nTypically, she called Jordyn twice a day\u2014once at 1:00 am and once at around 12:00 pm.\nHer colleagues at work were aware of this habit. What they didn't know was her daughter was the child she had with the company's CEO.\nAfter work, Celeste went to the supermarket. She bought some groceries and a few potted plants before heading home.\nAfter dinner, she browsed online for information about the upcoming technology exhibition. \nAfter that, she made a call. \"Please reserve a ticket for next month's tech exhibition for me.\"\n\"Are you sure?\" the person on the other end replied coolly. \"The last two times you asked me to reserve tickets, you didn't show up. Do you know how many people's lifelong dream is to get one of those tickets? You wasted them thoughtlessly.\"\nThe annual tech exhibition was a major event in the industry, and tickets were not easily obtainable.\nTheir company had a limited number of slots, and many IT elites working for them eagerly vied for the opportunity to attend it.\n\"If I don't show up to the exhibition this time, I will never ask you to reserve a ticket for me ever again,\" Celeste promised.\nThere was silence on the other end before the line disconnected. \nCeleste knew that he'd agreed. The corners of her mouth tugged upward into a smile. What she hadn't said was that she wanted to return to the company.\nThough she was one of the partners of her tech firm, she had stepped back during its early days to focus on marriage and family. Her decision had disrupted their development plans and cost them many opportunities.\nHer colleagues had been both angry and frustrated with her. Over the years, they had rarely been in contact.\nWhile Celeste was eager to return, she knew she had been out of the industry for too long. If she went back unprepared, she was worried she wouldn't be able to keep up with the company's current pace.\nSo, she planned to spend some time familiarizing herself with the industry's latest developments before making a concrete decision.\nFor the next few days, Celeste focused on her work during office hours and spent her evenings tending to her own matters. She didn't reach out to Jordyn or Trevor, and they didn't contact her either.\nCeleste wasn't surprised. For over half a year, her communication with them had been one-sided. They had only passively responded to her efforts.\n\u2026\nMeanwhile, in Andostan, Jordyn had developed the habit of calling Wynn first thing every morning.\nThat day, she called Wynn right after waking up as usual. However, the call didn't last long before she burst into tears.\nWynn had told her some bad news. \"I'm going back to the country soon.\"\nDevastated, Jordyn finished the call and immediately phoned Trevor. \"Dad, did you know about this?\"\nAt his office, Trevor flipped through some documents. \"Yes.\"\n\"When did you find out?\"\n\"It's been a while.\"\n\"Dad, you're so mean\u2026\" Jordyn hugged her pink stuffed pig and cried loudly. \"I don't want Wynn to leave. If she's not here, I don't want to go to school here anymore. I want to go back too!\"\nTrevor's tone remained even. \"It's already being arranged.\"\nJordyn didn't understand. \"W-What do you mean?\"\n\"We're going back next week.\"\nJordyn jumped out of bed in excitement. \"Really?\"\n\"Yes, really,\" Trevor replied.\n\"Then why didn't Wynn tell me just now?\"\n\"It was just finalized. She doesn't know yet.\"\nJordyn was ecstatic. \"Dad, let's keep this a secret from Wynn. We'll surprise her when we go back to the country, okay?\"\n\"Alright.\"\n\"You're the best, Dad! I love you so much!\"\nAfter hanging up, Jordyn was still overjoyed. She sang and danced on her bed.\nAfter a while, she suddenly thought of Celeste. For the past few days, she had been in a great mood because Celeste hadn't called her. In fact, to avoid talking to Celeste, she had deliberately left home early and even turned off her phone or kept it far away from her after school.\nBut after two days, she was worried that Celeste might get angry if she found out. So, she stopped doing that. To her surprise, Celeste hadn't called at all in the days that followed.\nAt first, she thought Celeste had discovered that she was deliberately avoiding her calls. But then she remembered that based on past experiences, that wasn't very likely. If Celeste knew she had done something wrong, she would immediately ask Jordyn to correct her wrongdoing instead of sulking and not calling.\nAfter all, she was the most important person to Celeste. Jordyn knew that Celeste loved her the most, so she didn't think that Celeste would purposely refrain from calling her simply because she was upset.\nAs Jordyn thought about this, she suddenly missed Celeste. It was the first time in days she had thought about Celeste, and she couldn't resist dialing Celeste's number.\nBut just as the call connected, she remembered that while she would get to see Wynn after returning to the country, Celeste would undoubtedly try every possible way to prevent her from meeting Wynn. She wouldn't be able to see Wynn whenever she wanted like she could now.\nThis thought dampened Jordyn's mood.\nIt was midnight in Celeste's time zone. She was already asleep when she was woken by the call. Upon seeing Jordyn's name on the screen, she was about to answer when the call abruptly disconnected.\nAlthough Celeste had written in her divorce agreement that she would relinquish custody of Jordyn, she still felt a sense of responsibility as her mother. Worried that something might have happened, Celeste immediately called back.\nWhen Jordyn saw the incoming call, she turned her head away and refused to answer.\nCeleste became more concerned and quickly called the landline at the villa.\nHannah answered promptly. After hearing Celeste's concerns, she reassured her, \"Ms. Fleming should be fine. She went to bed late last night and woke up late today. When I checked earlier, she was still asleep. I'll go upstairs to take a look and call you back.\"\nFeeling relieved, Celeste replied, \"Thank you.\"\nWhen Hannah went upstairs, Jordyn was already in the bathroom brushing her teeth.\nAfter Hannah relayed Celeste being worried about her, Jordyn lowered her head and lied, \"I accidentally hit the call button.\"\nHannah believed her and didn't doubt what she said. Seeing that Jordyn was still brushing her teeth, she went back downstairs to update Celeste that Jordyn was fine.\nJordyn watched as Hannah left. She huffed and finally felt a bit better.\nAfter hearing Hannah's reassurance, Celeste felt relieved too. Still, having been abruptly woken, she struggled to fall back asleep. She wasn't in great shape the next morning at work.\nThe envelope containing the divorce agreement was completely forgotten by Trevor after the phone call with Wynn.\nOn the day they returned to the country, Trevor packed the last document into his briefcase and ensured that nothing was left behind before heading downstairs.\n\"All set. Let's go.\"\nThe Lincoln stretch limousine departed from the villa and headed to the airport.\n\u2026\nThat night, at around 10:00 pm, the plane carrying Trevor and Jordyn landed on time. By the time they got home, it was nearly midnight. \nJordyn had fallen asleep before they arrived. When Trevor carried her upstairs, he passed the master bedroom and noticed the door was open, but the room was pitch black.\nAfter putting Jordyn on her bed and tucking her in, he returned to the master bedroom and turned on the light. Then, he glanced at the bed and found that it was empty\u2014Celeste wasn't there.\nJust then, the butler, Peter Hawk, came upstairs with his luggage. \nLoosening his tie, Trevor asked, \"Where is she?\"\nPeter replied, \"Mrs. Fleming is on a business trip.\"\nHalf a month ago, Peter hadn't been around when Celeste had left with her suitcase. The other maids told him that Celeste left with a suitcase, so he had assumed she was traveling for work.\nNow that he thought about it, this was unusual. Celeste rarely went on business trips. Even when she did, they typically lasted only two or three days.\nThis time, she had been gone for over two weeks.\n\"Alright,\" Trevor responded indifferently, asking no further questions.\n...\nThe next day, Celeste unexpectedly ran into Trevor at the company. She hadn't known that Trevor and Jordyn had returned to the country. Caught off guard by their sudden encounter, Celeste froze mid-step.\nTrevor also seemed slightly surprised to see her, but he assumed she had just returned from the business trip and didn't think much of it.\nHe passed by her coldly, his face expressionless. As usual, he treated her like she was a stranger and turned to enter the building.\nIn the past, if Celeste had found out that he'd suddenly come back, she would have been overjoyed. Even if she couldn't throw herself into his arms in such a scenario, she would have been very happy and excited. Her eyes would light up as she greeted him. \nEven if Trevor remained indifferent, she would have smiled and wished him good morning enthusiastically.\nBut now, Celeste merely glanced at his handsome face before lowering her eyes. There was no longer any trace of the joy and excitement she once felt.\nTrevor didn't notice any of this and was already walking away.\nWatching his tall and composed figure disappear into the building, Celeste wondered when he had returned. Since he was back, perhaps the matter of their divorce could soon be addressed.\nHaving resolved to go through with the divorce, Celeste didn't dwell on him further. After she returned to her workstation, she quickly immersed herself in her work.\nHalf an hour later, Zeke called her and instructed her to do something. \"Prepare two cups of coffee and take them to Mr. Fleming's office.\"\nIn the early days of her marriage, Celeste had learned that Trevor enjoyed coffee. In hopes of winning his favor, she had spent a great deal of effort studying how to brew it perfectly. Her efforts had paid off. After tasting her coffee, Trevor began to specifically request it, both at home and at the office.\nWhen she first realized he genuinely liked the coffee she made, Celeste had been thrilled. She naively believed it was the first step toward gaining his approval.\nBut she had underestimated his dislike and wariness of her. While he liked her coffee, that was all he liked. His attitude toward her remained cold and distant.\nEven when he wanted her coffee, he would have Zeke reach out to her. Once the coffee was prepared, someone else would pick it up for him. He never gave her the opportunity to approach him herself.\nOnly on rare occasions when no one else was available did she get the chance to deliver it to his office personally.\nThis time, it seemed she was to take the coffee directly to Trevor herself from Zeke's tone. After brewing the coffee, Celeste placed the cups on a tray and carried them to his office.\nThe door to his office was ajar.\nAs she approached and was about to knock on the door politely, she saw Wynn sitting on Trevor's lap. The two of them seemed to be locked in a passionate kiss.\nCeleste stopped in her tracks, her face turning pale.\nUpon seeing her, Wynn shot up from Trevor's lap, looking flustered.\nTrevor's expression darkened, and he questioned in an icy tone, \"Who allowed you to come in?\"\n..."

                  "text": "If your husband stayed cold around you, then his passion might have found someone else.\nCeleste looked into the restaurant - her husband wrapped his arms around his first love dotingly, while her daughter was giggling besides...she finally decided to let go.\nThe cheating husband, along with the daughter calling another woman \"mom\"\u2014she would throw them both out of her life!\n\nAfter seven years of marriage, my husband, Trevor, fell for another woman\u2014even our daughter wanted her as her new mom.\nI scoffed at the years I\u2019d wasted and handed him the divorce papers. Yet he dropped his usual aloofness, slamming me against the wall,\n\u201cDivorce? Not a chance.\u201d\n***\nWhen Celeste Rodriguez landed at the airport in Andostan, it was already past 9:00 pm.\nIt was her birthday. Her phone buzzed with messages from colleagues and friends\u2014but not a single one from her husband, Trevor Fleming.\nCeleste's smile faded.\nBy the time she reached the villa, it was already past 10:00 pm.\nHannah Lynd, the housekeeper looked startled. \"Mrs. Fleming... what a surprise.\"\n\"Where are Trevor and Jo?\" Celeste asked, handing over her luggage.\n\"Mr. Fleming isn\u2019t back yet. Miss Jordyn\u2019s upstairs playing.\"\nCeleste climbed the stairs. In her room, Jordyn sat in pajamas at her desk, completely absorbed.\n\"Jo?\" Celeste called.\nJordyn turned, her eyes lighting up. In a happy tone, she greeted, \"Mom!\"\nBut then she quickly got back to what she was doing earlier.\nCeleste walked over and hugged her tight, planting a kiss on her cheek. Yet the little one pushed her away and squirmed. \"Mom, I\u2019m busy.\" \nIt had been two months since Celeste last saw Jordyn. She missed her so much that no amount of kisses felt enough. She wanted to talk to Jordyn.\nShe noticed the necklace Jordyn was threading. \"Jo, are you making a seashell necklace?\"\n\"Mm-hm!\" Jordyn perked up visibly. \"Wynn's birthday is in a week. Dad and I picked and polished these ourselves. Pretty, right?\"\nCeleste\u2019s throat tightened. Jordyn didn\u2019t look up, only added brightly, \"Dad even got her a custom gift, tomorrow\u2014\"\nCeleste felt a pang in her chest and couldn't hold back anymore. \"Jo\u2026 Do you remember it's my birthday today?\"\n\"Huh?\" Jordyn glanced up briefly, then quickly looked back down at the string of beads in her hands, She complained, \"Mom, don\u2019t talk, Look, I messed up the bead order\u2014\"\nCeleste stood there in silence for a while, but Jordyn never looked back up. Finally, Celeste pursed her lips and left the room without another word.\nDownstairs, Hannah said, \"I called Mr. Fleming. He said he\u2019s busy tonight and you should rest first.\"\n\"I see.\" Celeste replied softly.\nShe hesitated, then called Trevor. It rang for a while before he answered.\nhis tone was indifferent as usual. \"I'm busy. Let's talk tomorrow\u2014\"\nA woman\u2019s voice chimed in: \"Trevor, who is it?\"\nWynn.\nCeleste gripped the phone tighter.\n\"No one important,\" Trevor answered her.\nBefore Celeste could say anything, Trevor had already hung up.\nCeleste stared at the screen. Two or three months apart, and this was all he had for her.\nAfter so many years of marriage, he\u2019d always been cold. Distant. Impatient. \nShe had got used to chasing after him, calling again, begging for time. Yet tonight, she didn\u2019t bother. \nPerhaps she was just too tired.\n\nThe next morning, Celeste thought it over and decided to call Trevor again.\nThere was a time difference of about 17 or 18 hours between Andostan and their home country. In Andostan, today was her actual birthday.\nShe didn\u2019t just come here for Jordyn. She wanted one thing: a family meal. Her only birthday wish.\nYet, Trevor didn\u2019t answer.\nA long time later, he texted: What\u2019s up?\nShe replied: Lunch today? Just the three of us.\nTrevor answered: Okay. Send the address.\nAlright, she typed back.\nThat was it. No acknowledgment. No \u201cHappy birthday.\u201d She wasn\u2019t surprised. But it still stung.\nAs she headed downstairs, she overheard Jordyn talking with Hannah.\n\"Aren't you happy that Mrs. Fleming is here, sweetie?\" Hannah asked.\n\"Dad and I promised to take Wynn to the beach tomorrow. If Mom comes, it'll be weird. She\u2019s always mean to Wynn.\"\n\"Mrs. Fleming is still your mom, sweetie. That\u2019s hurtful.\"\n\"I know, but Dad and I like Wynn more. Can't Wynn be my mom instead?\"\nCeleste froze.\nShe had raised Jordyn herself most of the time. But over the past two years, the more time Jordyn spent with Trevor, the more attached she became to him. When Trevor came to Andostan to expand his business last year, Jordyn had insisted on coming along.\nCeleste was reluctant and had hoped Jordyn would stay by her side. But she couldn't bear to see Jordyn upset, so she agreed.\nAnd now, Jordyn didn\u2019t even want her as her mom anymore.\nCeleste stood frozen in place, her face pale. To think that she had pushed aside her work to come to Andostan with the intention of spending more time with Jordyn.\nNow, it seemed unnecessary.\nShe walked back to her room, pale and quiet, then repacked the gifts she\u2019d brought.\nLater, Hannah texted: Madame, I took Jordyn out. Let me know if you need anything.\nCeleste sat on the bed, feeling hollow and lost inside. She had abandoned her work and made this trip, only to find no one wanted her here.\nHer arrival was nothing but a joke.\n\nAfter a long while, she left the villa. Aimlessly, she drove around in this foreign yet familiar country.\nBy noon, she remembered she had planned to have lunch with Trevor and Jordyn. As she recalled what she had overheard in the morning, she hesitated about whether to go home and pick up Jordyn. \nThen, a text from Trevor came: Something came up. Lunch\u2019s canceled.\nCeleste stared at it.\nShe should\u2019ve known. Trevor always canceled on her.  His work, friends, and everything else always came before her, his wife.\nOnce, she\u2019d cry. Today, she just felt\u2026 empty.\nCeleste was at an utter loss. She had come all this way excitedly only to be met with indifference from both Trevor and Jordyn.\nAimlessly, she drove around. Eventually, she found herself outside an old favorite restaurant which she and Trevor used to frequent.\nJust as she was about to walk in, she saw them.\nTrevor. Jordyn. Wynn.\nWynn sat next to Jordyn, laughing, feeding the little one the pastries she had taken a bite out of. Jordyn giggled, with her legs swinging around happily. Trevor smiled as he served food to both of them, but his gaze never left Wynn.\nWhat a happy family of three!\nSo this was his \"something came up.\"\nAnd this was the daughter she had carried for ten long months and nearly lost her life to bring into this world.\nCeleste laughed humorlessly. She stood there watching for a long time. Finally, she turned and drove away.\n\nBack at the villa, Celeste drafted the divorce agreement.\nTrevor had been her teenage dream\u2014but he had never truly seen her. If not for that one night and his grandfather Arnold Fleming\u2019s pressure, he never would\u2019ve married her. She thought loving him hard enough would be enough, but seven years proved otherwise.\nFor a long time, she felt lucky to have Jo\u2014her only source of comfort. But now, even Jo didn\u2019t seem to want her.\nThat was it.\nShe was done\u2014with the marriage, the lies, the thankless role of wife and mother. It was time to leave all this behind\u2014and reclaim the promising life she'd given up!\nShe sealed the divorce papers, handed them to Hannah, then grabbed her suitcase and walked out, bound for the airport. On the way, she finally dialed the number she\u2019d been avoiding for months.\nThe line rang once. Twice. A click.\n\u201cHello?\u201d\nShe took a breath, steady and sharp.\u201cThat offer still stand?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d\n...\nAt around 9:00 pm, Trevor and Jordyn returned home.\nJordyn clung to the hem of Trevor's coat and got out of the car sluggishly. Because Celeste was at home, she was reluctant to return that night.\nBut Wynn had said that Celeste came specifically to be with her and Trevor, and if they didn't return, she would be sad. Trevor also said that if they didn't go home that night, Celeste would definitely insist on joining them on their outing to the sea the next day.\nReluctantly, Jordyn agreed to come home.\nStill worried, she muttered gloomily, \"Dad, what if Mom insists on tagging along with us tomorrow?\"\n\"She won't,\" Trevor replied confidently.\nIn all the years they'd been married, Celeste had always tried to find ways to spend more time with him. But she was also sensible. As long as he made his stance clear, she wouldn't dare make him upset.\nIn Jordyn's memory, Celeste always listened to Trevor. Since he said she wouldn't, she felt reassured. As a result, her mood lifted. She made her way into the villa cheerfully and told Hannah she wanted to take a bath.\n\"Sure, sure,\" Hannah replied to Jordyn. Then, she remembered Celeste's instructions and handed an envelope to Trevor. \"Mr. Fleming, this is from Mrs. Fleming. She asked me to give it to you.\"\nTrevor took the envelope and asked casually, \"Where is she?\"\n\"Mrs. Fleming packed up and went back to the country this afternoon. Didn't you know?\" Hannah responded.\nTrevor paused mid-step as he was heading upstairs. He turned back, feeling a little surprised. \"Has she gone back?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nWhy had Celeste suddenly come to Andostan? Trevor hadn't given her a chance to tell him about it. He hadn't cared to ask either. Upon learning she'd left, he didn't dwell on it.\nJordyn was a little surprised too. When she heard the news, she felt a small twinge of disappointment. She'd been thinking that even if Celeste didn't join them for the outing tomorrow, it might be nice to have her around at home in the evening.\nPolishing the seashells made her hands hurt\u2014she had been counting on Celeste's help in finishing the necklace.\nThough it had been months since Trevor and Celeste had seen each other, she had made the effort to visit but only to leave without seeing him in person. Hannah recalled Celeste's grim expression as she left and thought that things felt a little off.\nShe couldn't help but say, \"Mr. Fleming, Mrs. Fleming looked upset when she left. She seemed angry.\"\nHannah had assumed Celeste's sudden departure was due to an urgent matter. Upon realizing Trevor hadn't known she'd left, she began to feel something was amiss.\n\"Angry?\" Trevor repeated in his mind. \nIn his presence, Celeste had always been patient and accommodating. So, she could get angry too? This was new.\nTrevor smiled faintly and responded to Hannah perfunctorily before heading upstairs.\nBack in the bedroom, he was about to open the envelope Celeste had left when Wynn called. After answering the call, he tossed the envelope aside and walked out the door.\nA short while later, the envelope slipped off the bed onto the floor.\nThat night, Trevor didn't return home.\nThe next day, Hannah noticed the envelope on the floor when she was cleaning. Recognizing it as the one Celeste had asked her to hand over, she assumed Trevor had already seen it and placed it in a nearby drawer.\n\u2026\nRight after getting off the plane, Celeste went home and began packing her belongings. She had accumulated quite a few things in the house since she'd been living there for six years, after all. But she only took a few sets of clothes, two sets of daily necessities, and some books that were related to her field of study back in college.\nAfter their marriage, Trevor had been depositing money for her and Jordyn into two separate accounts every month. One account was hers, and the other was Jordyn's.\nHowever, Celeste was used to spending her own money only. She had never touched the money in Jordyn's account. Because she loved Trevor, whenever she went shopping and saw clothes, shoes, cufflinks, or ties that suited him, she couldn't help but buy them.\nIn contrast, she didn't have many expenses on a daily basis because all she did was go to work. Her heart and mind were always focused on Trevor and Jordyn. She wanted to give them the best of everything.\nMost of the money Trevor deposited into her bank account was spent on him and Jordyn.\nGiven this spending pattern, there shouldn't have been much money left in Celeste's account. But over the past year, her opportunities to buy things for Trevor and Jordyn had decreased significantly because they were in Andostan.\nNow, there were over three million dollars in her account. That amount might not matter to Trevor, but to her, it was no small sum. And since it was her money, Celeste didn't hesitate to transfer it out.\nShe left both cards behind, dragged her suitcase out the door, and didn't look back.\nCeleste had an apartment near her workplace, which was a little over 1,100 square feet. She'd bought it four years ago to support a friend who had been struggling to meet their sales targets. She had never lived there before.\nNow, the apartment came in handy. She had it cleaned regularly, so it wasn't dirty. After a quick tidy-up, it was ready to move in.\nAfter a long day, Celeste washed up and went to bed around 10:00 pm.\n\u2026\nThe shrill sound of an alarm jolted Celeste awake. Startled, her mind went blank for a moment.\nWhen she came to her senses, she realized that while it was 1:00 am here, it was 7:00 am in Andostan, where Trevor and Jordyn were. This was their usual breakfast time.\nEver since Jordyn had gone to live with Trevor in Andostan, Celeste had developed the habit of calling her at this time every day. As she was always exhausted from work and was used to going to bed early, she had set this alarm to ensure she wouldn't miss the call.\nAt first, Jordyn hadn't adapted well to living in Andostan and had missed her terribly. She had called Celeste constantly. But as time went on, the calls that used to be full of yearning and dependence had grown perfunctory and impatient.\nThe alarm was no longer necessary. She just hadn't been able to let go.\nSmiling bitterly, Celeste deleted the alarm and turned off her phone before going back to sleep.\n\u2026\nMeanwhile, Trevor and Jordyn were nearly done with breakfast. Though he knew Celeste usually called Jordyn at this time, he wasn't always home and hadn't paid much attention to the routine.\nHe noticed that Celeste hadn't called that day. The fact registered in his mind, but he didn't care. After finishing breakfast, he went upstairs to change.\nJordyn, finding Celeste increasingly annoying, had grown less fond of their calls. Upon realizing that Celeste hadn't called yet, she figured something must have come up.\nShe grabbed her backpack and bolted for the door.\nHannah hurried after her. \"Ms. Fleming, it's still early. There's no rush!\"\nJordyn ignored her and ran to the car happily. She was thrilled that Celeste hadn't called on time that day. If she stayed home, she might still have to talk to Celeste later. Well, she didn't want that!\n\u2026\nAfter getting married to Trevor, Celeste had joined Fleming Group for his sake. Now that she was planning to divorce him, she saw no reason to stay.\nThe next morning, Celeste handed her resignation letter to Zeke Jackson after arriving at the office.\nZeke was one of Trevor's personal secretaries. When he saw Celeste's resignation letter, he was extremely surprised.\nHe was one of the few in the company who knew about the relationship between Celeste and Trevor.\nAnyone familiar with Trevor knew that he didn't love Celeste. So, he had been cold to her and rarely went home after their marriage.\nTo get closer to and win over Trevor, Celeste had chosen to work at Fleming Group.\nHer initial goal was to become his personal secretary, but Trevor refused vehemently. Even when Arnold stepped in, he couldn't get Trevor to agree. In the end, Celeste had to settle for a position in the secretarial team, becoming one of Trevor's many ordinary secretaries.\nAt first, Zeke had worried that Celeste's presence in the secretarial team would create chaos. But to his surprise, she didn't bring them any trouble. Although Celeste used her position to get closer to Trevor, she was mindful of her timing and never overstepped her boundaries. \nOn the contrary, she worked diligently and performed exceptionally well, hoping to gain Trevor's respect. Whether during her pregnancy, childbirth, or any other time, she strictly adhered to company policies and never sought special treatment.\nOver the years, Celeste rose to become the head of the secretarial team. Zeke had observed her feelings for Trevor from the sidelines all the while. To be honest, he had never imagined she would resign one day. He felt skeptical about her willingly giving up her position.\nSomething must have happened between Celeste and Trevor for her to resign now. Zeke understood that this was something he wasn't privy to\u2014it must be something significant enough for Trevor to have ordered her to resign.\nWhile he found it a pity, Zeke maintained a professional tone. \"I acknowledge that I've received your resignation letter. I'll arrange for someone to take over your duties as soon as possible.\"\n\"Alright.\" Celeste nodded and returned to her workstation.\nAfter working for a while, Zeke started an online meeting with Trevor to report on company matters. As the conversation neared its end, he suddenly remembered Celeste's resignation. \n\"Oh, Mr. Fleming, there's one more thing\u2014\"\nAlthough Zeke had told Celeste he would quickly arrange for someone to take over her position, he wanted to gauge Trevor's thoughts on the matter first. If Trevor wanted Celeste out immediately, he would make the arrangements right away.\nBut as the words left his mouth, he remembered that when Celeste first joined the company, Trevor had explicitly stated that all matters regarding her employment should be handled per company regulations. He made it clear that there was no need to report anything to him since he wouldn't concern himself with her.\nAnd indeed, over the years, Trevor had never actively inquired about Celeste's work at the company.\nEven when he encountered her at work, he treated her like she was a complete stranger.\nWhen Celeste was set to be promoted a couple of years ago, the team had hesitated. Everyone was aware of Trevor's dislike for her. They had even brought it up with him to gauge his opinion back then.\nTrevor had frowned in annoyance and reiterated that he wouldn't interfere and that they should handle it according to company policy. He had emphasized that they shouldn't bring up Celeste's matters with him again.\nSeeing Zeke's hesitation, Trevor frowned. \"What is it?\"\nZeke snapped out of his thoughts and quickly replied, \"Oh, it's nothing.\"\nSince Trevor was already aware of Celeste's resignation but hadn't brought it up, it was clear that this matter wasn't important to him. So, Zeke decided to proceed as usual and handle the matter according to company regulations.\nWith that resolved, Trevor ended the call.\n\u2026\n\"What are you thinking about?\" At noon, a colleague patted Celeste on the shoulder.\nCeleste came back to her senses and smiled, shaking her head. \"Nothing.\"\n\"Don't you need to call your daughter today?\"\n\"No, not today.\"\nTypically, she called Jordyn twice a day\u2014once at 1:00 am and once at around 12:00 pm.\nHer colleagues at work were aware of this habit. What they didn't know was her daughter was the child she had with the company's CEO.\nAfter work, Celeste went to the supermarket. She bought some groceries and a few potted plants before heading home.\nAfter dinner, she browsed online for information about the upcoming technology exhibition. \nAfter that, she made a call. \"Please reserve a ticket for next month's tech exhibition for me.\"\n\"Are you sure?\" the person on the other end replied coolly. \"The last two times you asked me to reserve tickets, you didn't show up. Do you know how many people's lifelong dream is to get one of those tickets? You wasted them thoughtlessly.\"\nThe annual tech exhibition was a major event in the industry, and tickets were not easily obtainable.\nTheir company had a limited number of slots, and many IT elites working for them eagerly vied for the opportunity to attend it.\n\"If I don't show up to the exhibition this time, I will never ask you to reserve a ticket for me ever again,\" Celeste promised.\nThere was silence on the other end before the line disconnected. \nCeleste knew that he'd agreed. The corners of her mouth tugged upward into a smile. What she hadn't said was that she wanted to return to the company.\nThough she was one of the partners of her tech firm, she had stepped back during its early days to focus on marriage and family. Her decision had disrupted their development plans and cost them many opportunities.\nHer colleagues had been both angry and frustrated with her. Over the years, they had rarely been in contact.\nWhile Celeste was eager to return, she knew she had been out of the industry for too long. If she went back unprepared, she was worried she wouldn't be able to keep up with the company's current pace.\nSo, she planned to spend some time familiarizing herself with the industry's latest developments before making a concrete decision.\nFor the next few days, Celeste focused on her work during office hours and spent her evenings tending to her own matters. She didn't reach out to Jordyn or Trevor, and they didn't contact her either.\nCeleste wasn't surprised. For over half a year, her communication with them had been one-sided. They had only passively responded to her efforts.\n\u2026\nMeanwhile, in Andostan, Jordyn had developed the habit of calling Wynn first thing every morning.\nThat day, she called Wynn right after waking up as usual. However, the call didn't last long before she burst into tears.\nWynn had told her some bad news. \"I'm going back to the country soon.\"\nDevastated, Jordyn finished the call and immediately phoned Trevor. \"Dad, did you know about this?\"\nAt his office, Trevor flipped through some documents. \"Yes.\"\n\"When did you find out?\"\n\"It's been a while.\"\n\"Dad, you're so mean\u2026\" Jordyn hugged her pink stuffed pig and cried loudly. \"I don't want Wynn to leave. If she's not here, I don't want to go to school here anymore. I want to go back too!\"\nTrevor's tone remained even. \"It's already being arranged.\"\nJordyn didn't understand. \"W-What do you mean?\"\n\"We're going back next week.\"\nJordyn jumped out of bed in excitement. \"Really?\"\n\"Yes, really,\" Trevor replied.\n\"Then why didn't Wynn tell me just now?\"\n\"It was just finalized. She doesn't know yet.\"\nJordyn was ecstatic. \"Dad, let's keep this a secret from Wynn. We'll surprise her when we go back to the country, okay?\"\n\"Alright.\"\n\"You're the best, Dad! I love you so much!\"\nAfter hanging up, Jordyn was still overjoyed. She sang and danced on her bed.\nAfter a while, she suddenly thought of Celeste. For the past few days, she had been in a great mood because Celeste hadn't called her. In fact, to avoid talking to Celeste, she had deliberately left home early and even turned off her phone or kept it far away from her after school.\nBut after two days, she was worried that Celeste might get angry if she found out. So, she stopped doing that. To her surprise, Celeste hadn't called at all in the days that followed.\nAt first, she thought Celeste had discovered that she was deliberately avoiding her calls. But then she remembered that based on past experiences, that wasn't very likely. If Celeste knew she had done something wrong, she would immediately ask Jordyn to correct her wrongdoing instead of sulking and not calling.\nAfter all, she was the most important person to Celeste. Jordyn knew that Celeste loved her the most, so she didn't think that Celeste would purposely refrain from calling her simply because she was upset.\nAs Jordyn thought about this, she suddenly missed Celeste. It was the first time in days she had thought about Celeste, and she couldn't resist dialing Celeste's number.\nBut just as the call connected, she remembered that while she would get to see Wynn after returning to the country, Celeste would undoubtedly try every possible way to prevent her from meeting Wynn. She wouldn't be able to see Wynn whenever she wanted like she could now.\nThis thought dampened Jordyn's mood.\nIt was midnight in Celeste's time zone. She was already asleep when she was woken by the call. Upon seeing Jordyn's name on the screen, she was about to answer when the call abruptly disconnected.\nAlthough Celeste had written in her divorce agreement that she would relinquish custody of Jordyn, she still felt a sense of responsibility as her mother. Worried that something might have happened, Celeste immediately called back.\nWhen Jordyn saw the incoming call, she turned her head away and refused to answer.\nCeleste became more concerned and quickly called the landline at the villa.\nHannah answered promptly. After hearing Celeste's concerns, she reassured her, \"Ms. Fleming should be fine. She went to bed late last night and woke up late today. When I checked earlier, she was still asleep. I'll go upstairs to take a look and call you back.\"\nFeeling relieved, Celeste replied, \"Thank you.\"\nWhen Hannah went upstairs, Jordyn was already in the bathroom brushing her teeth.\nAfter Hannah relayed Celeste being worried about her, Jordyn lowered her head and lied, \"I accidentally hit the call button.\"\nHannah believed her and didn't doubt what she said. Seeing that Jordyn was still brushing her teeth, she went back downstairs to update Celeste that Jordyn was fine.\nJordyn watched as Hannah left. She huffed and finally felt a bit better.\nAfter hearing Hannah's reassurance, Celeste felt relieved too. Still, having been abruptly woken, she struggled to fall back asleep. She wasn't in great shape the next morning at work.\nThe envelope containing the divorce agreement was completely forgotten by Trevor after the phone call with Wynn.\nOn the day they returned to the country, Trevor packed the last document into his briefcase and ensured that nothing was left behind before heading downstairs.\n\"All set. Let's go.\"\nThe Lincoln stretch limousine departed from the villa and headed to the airport.\n\u2026\nThat night, at around 10:00 pm, the plane carrying Trevor and Jordyn landed on time. By the time they got home, it was nearly midnight. \nJordyn had fallen asleep before they arrived. When Trevor carried her upstairs, he passed the master bedroom and noticed the door was open, but the room was pitch black.\nAfter putting Jordyn on her bed and tucking her in, he returned to the master bedroom and turned on the light. Then, he glanced at the bed and found that it was empty\u2014Celeste wasn't there.\nJust then, the butler, Peter Hawk, came upstairs with his luggage. \nLoosening his tie, Trevor asked, \"Where is she?\"\nPeter replied, \"Mrs. Fleming is on a business trip.\"\nHalf a month ago, Peter hadn't been around when Celeste had left with her suitcase. The other maids told him that Celeste left with a suitcase, so he had assumed she was traveling for work.\nNow that he thought about it, this was unusual. Celeste rarely went on business trips. Even when she did, they typically lasted only two or three days.\nThis time, she had been gone for over two weeks.\n\"Alright,\" Trevor responded indifferently, asking no further questions.\n...\nThe next day, Celeste unexpectedly ran into Trevor at the company. She hadn't known that Trevor and Jordyn had returned to the country. Caught off guard by their sudden encounter, Celeste froze mid-step.\nTrevor also seemed slightly surprised to see her, but he assumed she had just returned from the business trip and didn't think much of it.\nHe passed by her coldly, his face expressionless. As usual, he treated her like she was a stranger and turned to enter the building.\nIn the past, if Celeste had found out that he'd suddenly come back, she would have been overjoyed. Even if she couldn't throw herself into his arms in such a scenario, she would have been very happy and excited. Her eyes would light up as she greeted him. \nEven if Trevor remained indifferent, she would have smiled and wished him good morning enthusiastically.\nBut now, Celeste merely glanced at his handsome face before lowering her eyes. There was no longer any trace of the joy and excitement she once felt.\nTrevor didn't notice any of this and was already walking away.\nWatching his tall and composed figure disappear into the building, Celeste wondered when he had returned. Since he was back, perhaps the matter of their divorce could soon be addressed.\nHaving resolved to go through with the divorce, Celeste didn't dwell on him further. After she returned to her workstation, she quickly immersed herself in her work.\nHalf an hour later, Zeke called her and instructed her to do something. \"Prepare two cups of coffee and take them to Mr. Fleming's office.\"\nIn the early days of her marriage, Celeste had learned that Trevor enjoyed coffee. In hopes of winning his favor, she had spent a great deal of effort studying how to brew it perfectly. Her efforts had paid off. After tasting her coffee, Trevor began to specifically request it, both at home and at the office.\nWhen she first realized he genuinely liked the coffee she made, Celeste had been thrilled. She naively believed it was the first step toward gaining his approval.\nBut she had underestimated his dislike and wariness of her. While he liked her coffee, that was all he liked. His attitude toward her remained cold and distant.\nEven when he wanted her coffee, he would have Zeke reach out to her. Once the coffee was prepared, someone else would pick it up for him. He never gave her the opportunity to approach him herself.\nOnly on rare occasions when no one else was available did she get the chance to deliver it to his office personally.\nThis time, it seemed she was to take the coffee directly to Trevor herself from Zeke's tone. After brewing the coffee, Celeste placed the cups on a tray and carried them to his office.\nThe door to his office was ajar.\nAs she approached and was about to knock on the door politely, she saw Wynn sitting on Trevor's lap. The two of them seemed to be locked in a passionate kiss.\nCeleste stopped in her tracks, her face turning pale.\nUpon seeing her, Wynn shot up from Trevor's lap, looking flustered.\nTrevor's expression darkened, and he questioned in an icy tone, \"Who allowed you to come in?\"\n..."

Yet he dropped his usual aloofness, slamming me against the wall,\n\u201cDivorce? Not a chance.\u201d\n***\nWhen Celeste Rodriguez landed at the airport in Andostan, it was already past 9:00 pm.\nIt was her birthday. Her phone buzzed with messages from colleagues and friends\u2014but not a single one from her husband, Trevor Fleming.\nCeleste's smile faded.\nBy the time she reached the villa, it was already past 10:00 pm.\nHannah Lynd, the housekeeper looked startled. \"Mrs. Fleming... what a surprise.\"\n\"Where are Trevor and Jo?\" Celeste asked, handing over her luggage.\n\"Mr. Fleming isn\u2019t back yet. Miss Jordyn\u2019s upstairs playing.\"\nCeleste climbed the stairs. In her room, Jordyn sat in pajamas at her desk, completely absorbed.\n\"Jo?\" Celeste called.\nJordyn turned, her eyes lighting up. In a happy tone, she greeted, \"Mom!\"\nBut then she quickly got back to what she was doing earlier.\nCeleste walked over and hugged her tight, planting a kiss on her cheek. Yet the little one pushed her away and squirmed. \"Mom, I\u2019m busy.\" \nIt had been two months since Celeste last saw Jordyn. She missed her so much that no amount of kisses felt enough. She wanted to talk to Jordyn.\nShe noticed the necklace Jordyn was threading. \"Jo, are you making a seashell necklace?\"\n\"Mm-hm!\" Jordyn perked up visibly. \"Wynn's birthday is in a week. Dad and I picked and polished these ourselves. Pretty, right?\"\nCeleste\u2019s throat tightened. Jordyn didn\u2019t look up, only added brightly, \"Dad even got her a custom gift, tomorrow\u2014\"\nCeleste felt a pang in her chest and couldn't hold back anymore. \"Jo\u2026 Do you remember it's my birthday today?\"\n\"Huh?\" Jordyn glanced up briefly, then quickly looked back down at the string of beads in her hands, She complained, \"Mom, don\u2019t talk, Look, I messed up the bead order\u2014\"\nCeleste stood there in silence for a while, but Jordyn never looked back up. Finally, Celeste pursed her lips and left the room without another word.\nDownstairs, Hannah said, \"I called Mr. Fleming. He said he\u2019s busy tonight and you should rest first.\"\n\"I see.\" Celeste replied softly.\nShe hesitated, then called Trevor. It rang for a while before he answered.\nhis tone was indifferent as usual. \"I'm busy. Let's talk tomorrow\u2014\"\nA woman\u2019s voice chimed in: \"Trevor, who is it?\"\nWynn.\nCeleste gripped the phone tighter.\n\"No one important,\" Trevor answered her.\nBefore Celeste could say anything, Trevor had already hung up.\nCeleste stared at the screen. Two or three months apart, and this was all he had for her.\nAfter so many years of marriage, he\u2019d always been cold. Distant. Impatient. \nShe had got used to chasing after him, calling again, begging for time. Yet tonight, she didn\u2019t bother. \nPerhaps she was just too tired.\n\nThe next morning, Celeste thought it over and decided to call Trevor again.\nThere was a time difference of about 17 or 18 hours between Andostan and their home country. In Andostan, today was her actual birthday.\nShe didn\u2019t just come here for Jordyn. She wanted one thing: a family meal. Her only birthday wish.\nYet, Trevor didn\u2019t answer.\nA long time later, he texted: What\u2019s up?\nShe replied: Lunch today? Just the three of us.\nTrevor answered: Okay. Send the address.\nAlright, she typed back.\nThat was it. No acknowledgment. No \u201cHappy birthday.\u201d She wasn\u2019t surprised. But it still stung.\nAs she headed downstairs, she overheard Jordyn talking with Hannah.\n\"Aren't you happy that Mrs. Fleming is here, sweetie?\" Hannah asked.\n\"Dad and I promised to take Wynn to the beach tomorrow. If Mom comes, it'll be weird. She\u2019s always mean to Wynn.\"\n\"Mrs. Fleming is still your mom, sweetie. That\u2019s hurtful.\"\n\"I know, but Dad and I like Wynn more. Can't Wynn be my mom instead?\"\nCeleste froze.\nShe had raised Jordyn herself most of the time. But over the past two years, the more time Jordyn spent with Trevor, the more attached she became to him. When Trevor came to Andostan to expand his business last year, Jordyn had insisted on coming along.\nCeleste was reluctant and had hoped Jordyn would stay by her side. But she couldn't bear to see Jordyn upset, so she agreed.\nAnd now, Jordyn didn\u2019t even want her as her mom anymore.\nCeleste stood frozen in place, her face pale. To think that she had pushed aside her work to come to Andostan with the intention of spending more time with Jordyn.\nNow, it seemed unnecessary.\nShe walked back to her room, pale and quiet, then repacked the gifts she\u2019d brought.\nLater, Hannah texted: Madame, I took Jordyn out. Let me know if you need anything.\nCeleste sat on the bed, feeling hollow and lost inside. She had abandoned her work and made this trip, only to find no one wanted her here.\nHer arrival was nothing but a joke.\n\nAfter a long while, she left the villa. Aimlessly, she drove around in this foreign yet familiar country.\nBy noon, she remembered she had planned to have lunch with Trevor and Jordyn. As she recalled what she had overheard in the morning, she hesitated about whether to go home and pick up Jordyn. \nThen, a text from Trevor came: Something came up. Lunch\u2019s canceled.\nCeleste stared at it.\nShe should\u2019ve known. Trevor always canceled on her.  His work, friends, and everything else always came before her, his wife.\nOnce, she\u2019d cry. Today, she just felt\u2026 empty.\nCeleste was at an utter loss. She had come all this way excitedly only to be met with indifference from both Trevor and Jordyn.\nAimlessly, she drove around. Eventually, she found herself outside an old favorite restaurant which she and Trevor used to frequent.\nJust as she was about to walk in, she saw them.\nTrevor. Jordyn. Wynn.\nWynn sat next to Jordyn, laughing, feeding the little one the pastries she had taken a bite out of. Jordyn giggled, with her legs swinging around happily. Trevor smiled as he served food to both of them, but his gaze never left Wynn.\nWhat a happy family of three!\nSo this was his \"something came up.\"\nAnd this was the daughter she had carried for ten long months and nearly lost her life to bring into this world.\nCeleste laughed humorlessly. She stood there watching for a long time. Finally, she turned and drove away.\n\nBack at the villa, Celeste drafted the divorce agreement.\nTrevor had been her teenage dream\u2014but he had never truly seen her. If not for that one night and his grandfather Arnold Fleming\u2019s pressure, he never would\u2019ve married her. She thought loving him hard enough would be enough, but seven years proved otherwise.\nFor a long time, she felt lucky to have Jo\u2014her only source of comfort. But now, even Jo didn\u2019t seem to want her.\nThat was it.\nShe was done\u2014with the marriage, the lies, the thankless role of wife and mother. It was time to leave all this behind\u2014and reclaim the promising life she'd given up!\nShe sealed the divorce papers, handed them to Hannah, then grabbed her suitcase and walked out, bound for the airport. On the way, she finally dialed the number she\u2019d been avoiding for months.\nThe line rang once. Twice. A click.\n\u201cHello?\u201d\nShe took a breath, steady and sharp.\u201cThat offer still stand?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d\n...\nAt around 9:00 pm, Trevor and Jordyn returned home.\nJordyn clung to the hem of Trevor's coat and got out of the car sluggishly. Because Celeste was at home, she was reluctant to return that night.\nBut Wynn had said that Celeste came specifically to be with her and Trevor, and if they didn't return, she would be sad. Trevor also said that if they didn't go home that night, Celeste would definitely insist on joining them on their outing to the sea the next day.\nReluctantly, Jordyn agreed to come home.\nStill worried, she muttered gloomily, \"Dad, what if Mom insists on tagging along with us tomorrow?\"\n\"She won't,\" Trevor replied confidently.\nIn all the years they'd been married, Celeste had always tried to find ways to spend more time with him. But she was also sensible. As long as he made his stance clear, she wouldn't dare make him upset.\nIn Jordyn's memory, Celeste always listened to Trevor. Since he said she wouldn't, she felt reassured. As a result, her mood lifted. She made her way into the villa cheerfully and told Hannah she wanted to take a bath.\n\"Sure, sure,\" Hannah replied to Jordyn. Then, she remembered Celeste's instructions and handed an envelope to Trevor. \"Mr. Fleming, this is from Mrs. Fleming. She asked me to give it to you.\"\nTrevor took the envelope and asked casually, \"Where is she?\"\n\"Mrs. Fleming packed up and went back to the country this afternoon. Didn't you know?\" Hannah responded.\nTrevor paused mid-step as he was heading upstairs. He turned back, feeling a little surprised. \"Has she gone back?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nWhy had Celeste suddenly come to Andostan? Trevor hadn't given her a chance to tell him about it. He hadn't cared to ask either. Upon learning she'd left, he didn't dwell on it.\nJordyn was a little surprised too. When she heard the news, she felt a small twinge of disappointment. She'd been thinking that even if Celeste didn't join them for the outing tomorrow, it might be nice to have her around at home in the evening.\nPolishing the seashells made her hands hurt\u2014she had been counting on Celeste's help in finishing the necklace.\nThough it had been months since Trevor and Celeste had seen each other, she had made the effort to visit but only to leave without seeing him in person. Hannah recalled Celeste's grim expression as she left and thought that things felt a little off.\nShe couldn't help but say, \"Mr. Fleming, Mrs. Fleming looked upset when she left. She seemed angry.\"\nHannah had assumed Celeste's sudden departure was due to an urgent matter. Upon realizing Trevor hadn't known she'd left, she began to feel something was amiss.\n\"Angry?\" Trevor repeated in his mind. \nIn his presence, Celeste had always been patient and accommodating. So, she could get angry too? This was new.\nTrevor smiled faintly and responded to Hannah perfunctorily before heading upstairs.\nBack in the bedroom, he was about to open the envelope Celeste had left when Wynn called. After answering the call, he tossed the envelope aside and walked out the door.\nA short while later, the envelope slipped off the bed onto the floor.\nThat night, Trevor didn't return home.\nThe next day, Hannah noticed the envelope on the floor when she was cleaning. Recognizing it as the one Celeste had asked her to hand over, she assumed Trevor had already seen it and placed it in a nearby drawer.\n\u2026\nRight after getting off the plane, Celeste went home and began packing her belongings. She had accumulated quite a few things in the house since she'd been living there for six years, after all. But she only took a few sets of clothes, two sets of daily necessities, and some books that were related to her field of study back in college.\nAfter their marriage, Trevor had been depositing money for her and Jordyn into two separate accounts every month. One account was hers, and the other was Jordyn's.\nHowever, Celeste was used to spending her own money only. She had never touched the money in Jordyn's account. Because she loved Trevor, whenever she went shopping and saw clothes, shoes, cufflinks, or ties that suited him, she couldn't help but buy them.\nIn contrast, she didn't have many expenses on a daily basis because all she did was go to work. Her heart and mind were always focused on Trevor and Jordyn. She wanted to give them the best of everything.\nMost of the money Trevor deposited into her bank account was spent on him and Jordyn.\nGiven this spending pattern, there shouldn't have been much money left in Celeste's account. But over the past year, her opportunities to buy things for Trevor and Jordyn had decreased significantly because they were in Andostan.\nNow, there were over three million dollars in her account. That amount might not matter to Trevor, but to her, it was no small sum. And since it was her money, Celeste didn't hesitate to transfer it out.\nShe left both cards behind, dragged her suitcase out the door, and didn't look back.\nCeleste had an apartment near her workplace, which was a little over 1,100 square feet. She'd bought it four years ago to support a friend who had been struggling to meet their sales targets. She had never lived there before.\nNow, the apartment came in handy. She had it cleaned regularly, so it wasn't dirty. After a quick tidy-up, it was ready to move in.\nAfter a long day, Celeste washed up and went to bed around 10:00 pm.\n\u2026\nThe shrill sound of an alarm jolted Celeste awake. Startled, her mind went blank for a moment.\nWhen she came to her senses, she realized that while it was 1:00 am here, it was 7:00 am in Andostan, where Trevor and Jordyn were. This was their usual breakfast time.\nEver since Jordyn had gone to live with Trevor in Andostan, Celeste had developed the habit of calling her at this time every day. As she was always exhausted from work and was used to going to bed early, she had set this alarm to ensure she wouldn't miss the call.\nAt first, Jordyn hadn't adapted well to living in Andostan and had missed her terribly. She had called Celeste constantly. But as time went on, the calls that used to be full of yearning and dependence had grown perfunctory and impatient.\nThe alarm was no longer necessary. She just hadn't been able to let go.\nSmiling bitterly, Celeste deleted the alarm and turned off her phone before going back to sleep.\n\u2026\nMeanwhile, Trevor and Jordyn were nearly done with breakfast. Though he knew Celeste usually called Jordyn at this time, he wasn't always home and hadn't paid much attention to the routine.\nHe noticed that Celeste hadn't called that day. The fact registered in his mind, but he didn't care. After finishing breakfast, he went upstairs to change.\nJordyn, finding Celeste increasingly annoying, had grown less fond of their calls. Upon realizing that Celeste hadn't called yet, she figured something must have come up.\nShe grabbed her backpack and bolted for the door.\nHannah hurried after her. \"Ms. Fleming, it's still early. There's no rush!\"\nJordyn ignored her and ran to the car happily. She was thrilled that Celeste hadn't called on time that day. If she stayed home, she might still have to talk to Celeste later. Well, she didn't want that!\n\u2026\nAfter getting married to Trevor, Celeste had joined Fleming Group for his sake. Now that she was planning to divorce him, she saw no reason to stay.\nThe next morning, Celeste handed her resignation letter to Zeke Jackson after arriving at the office.\nZeke was one of Trevor's personal secretaries. When he saw Celeste's resignation letter, he was extremely surprised.\nHe was one of the few in the company who knew about the relationship between Celeste and Trevor.\nAnyone familiar with Trevor knew that he didn't love Celeste. So, he had been cold to her and rarely went home after their marriage.\nTo get closer to and win over Trevor, Celeste had chosen to work at Fleming Group.\nHer initial goal was to become his personal secretary, but Trevor refused vehemently. Even when Arnold stepped in, he couldn't get Trevor to agree. In the end, Celeste had to settle for a position in the secretarial team, becoming one of Trevor's many ordinary secretaries.\nAt first, Zeke had worried that Celeste's presence in the secretarial team would create chaos. But to his surprise, she didn't bring them any trouble. Although Celeste used her position to get closer to Trevor, she was mindful of her timing and never overstepped her boundaries. \nOn the contrary, she worked diligently and performed exceptionally well, hoping to gain Trevor's respect. Whether during her pregnancy, childbirth, or any other time, she strictly adhered to company policies and never sought special treatment.\nOver the years, Celeste rose to become the head of the secretarial team. Zeke had observed her feelings for Trevor from the sidelines all the while. To be honest, he had never imagined she would resign one day. He felt skeptical about her willingly giving up her position.\nSomething must have happened between Celeste and Trevor for her to resign now. Zeke understood that this was something he wasn't privy to\u2014it must be something significant enough for Trevor to have ordered her to resign.\nWhile he found it a pity, Zeke maintained a professional tone. \"I acknowledge that I've received your resignation letter. I'll arrange for someone to take over your duties as soon as possible.\"\n\"Alright.\" Celeste nodded and returned to her workstation.\nAfter working for a while, Zeke started an online meeting with Trevor to report on company matters. As the conversation neared its end, he suddenly remembered Celeste's resignation. \n\"Oh, Mr. Fleming, there's one more thing\u2014\"\nAlthough Zeke had told Celeste he would quickly arrange for someone to take over her position, he wanted to gauge Trevor's thoughts on the matter first. If Trevor wanted Celeste out immediately, he would make the arrangements right away.\nBut as the words left his mouth, he remembered that when Celeste first joined the company, Trevor had explicitly stated that all matters regarding her employment should be handled per company regulations. He made it clear that there was no need to report anything to him since he wouldn't concern himself with her.\nAnd indeed, over the years, Trevor had never actively inquired about Celeste's work at the company.\nEven when he encountered her at work, he treated her like she was a complete stranger.\nWhen Celeste was set to be promoted a couple of years ago, the team had hesitated. Everyone was aware of Trevor's dislike for her. They had even brought it up with him to gauge his opinion back then.\nTrevor had frowned in annoyance and reiterated that he wouldn't interfere and that they should handle it according to company policy. He had emphasized that they shouldn't bring up Celeste's matters with him again.\nSeeing Zeke's hesitation, Trevor frowned. \"What is it?\"\nZeke snapped out of his thoughts and quickly replied, \"Oh, it's nothing.\"\nSince Trevor was already aware of Celeste's resignation but hadn't brought it up, it was clear that this matter wasn't important to him. So, Zeke decided to proceed as usual and handle the matter according to company regulations.\nWith that resolved, Trevor ended the call.\n\u2026\n\"What are you thinking about?\" At noon, a colleague patted Celeste on the shoulder.\nCeleste came back to her senses and smiled, shaking her head. \"Nothing.\"\n\"Don't you need to call your daughter today?\"\n\"No, not today.\"\nTypically, she called Jordyn twice a day\u2014once at 1:00 am and once at around 12:00 pm.\nHer colleagues at work were aware of this habit. What they didn't know was her daughter was the child she had with the company's CEO.\nAfter work, Celeste went to the supermarket. She bought some groceries and a few potted plants before heading home.\nAfter dinner, she browsed online for information about the upcoming technology exhibition. \nAfter that, she made a call. \"Please reserve a ticket for next month's tech exhibition for me.\"\n\"Are you sure?\" the person on the other end replied coolly. \"The last two times you asked me to reserve tickets, you didn't show up. Do you know how many people's lifelong dream is to get one of those tickets? You wasted them thoughtlessly.\"\nThe annual tech exhibition was a major event in the industry, and tickets were not easily obtainable.\nTheir company had a limited number of slots, and many IT elites working for them eagerly vied for the opportunity to attend it.\n\"If I don't show up to the exhibition this time, I will never ask you to reserve a ticket for me ever again,\" Celeste promised.\nThere was silence on the other end before the line disconnected. \nCeleste knew that he'd agreed. The corners of her mouth tugged upward into a smile. What she hadn't said was that she wanted to return to the company.\nThough she was one of the partners of her tech firm, she had stepped back during its early days to focus on marriage and family. Her decision had disrupted their development plans and cost them many opportunities.\nHer colleagues had been both angry and frustrated with her. Over the years, they had rarely been in contact.\nWhile Celeste was eager to return, she knew she had been out of the industry for too long. If she went back unprepared, she was worried she wouldn't be able to keep up with the company's current pace.\nSo, she planned to spend some time familiarizing herself with the industry's latest developments before making a concrete decision.\nFor the next few days, Celeste focused on her work during office hours and spent her evenings tending to her own matters. She didn't reach out to Jordyn or Trevor, and they didn't contact her either.\nCeleste wasn't surprised. For over half a year, her communication with them had been one-sided. They had only passively responded to her efforts.\n\u2026\nMeanwhile, in Andostan, Jordyn had developed the habit of calling Wynn first thing every morning.\nThat day, she called Wynn right after waking up as usual. However, the call didn't last long before she burst into tears.\nWynn had told her some bad news. \"I'm going back to the country soon.\"\nDevastated, Jordyn finished the call and immediately phoned Trevor. \"Dad, did you know about this?\"\nAt his office, Trevor flipped through some documents. \"Yes.\"\n\"When did you find out?\"\n\"It's been a while.\"\n\"Dad, you're so mean\u2026\" Jordyn hugged her pink stuffed pig and cried loudly. \"I don't want Wynn to leave. If she's not here, I don't want to go to school here anymore. I want to go back too!\"\nTrevor's tone remained even. \"It's already being arranged.\"\nJordyn didn't understand. \"W-What do you mean?\"\n\"We're going back next week.\"\nJordyn jumped out of bed in excitement. \"Really?\"\n\"Yes, really,\" Trevor replied.\n\"Then why didn't Wynn tell me just now?\"\n\"It was just finalized. She doesn't know yet.\"\nJordyn was ecstatic. \"Dad, let's keep this a secret from Wynn. We'll surprise her when we go back to the country, okay?\"\n\"Alright.\"\n\"You're the best, Dad! I love you so much!\"\nAfter hanging up, Jordyn was still overjoyed. She sang and danced on her bed.\nAfter a while, she suddenly thought of Celeste. For the past few days, she had been in a great mood because Celeste hadn't called her. In fact, to avoid talking to Celeste, she had deliberately left home early and even turned off her phone or kept it far away from her after school.\nBut after two days, she was worried that Celeste might get angry if she found out. So, she stopped doing that. To her surprise, Celeste hadn't called at all in the days that followed.\nAt first, she thought Celeste had discovered that she was deliberately avoiding her calls. But then she remembered that based on past experiences, that wasn't very likely. If Celeste knew she had done something wrong, she would immediately ask Jordyn to correct her wrongdoing instead of sulking and not calling.\nAfter all, she was the most important person to Celeste. Jordyn knew that Celeste loved her the most, so she didn't think that Celeste would purposely refrain from calling her simply because she was upset.\nAs Jordyn thought about this, she suddenly missed Celeste. It was the first time in days she had thought about Celeste, and she couldn't resist dialing Celeste's number.\nBut just as the call connected, she remembered that while she would get to see Wynn after returning to the country, Celeste would undoubtedly try every possible way to prevent her from meeting Wynn. She wouldn't be able to see Wynn whenever she wanted like she could now.\nThis thought dampened Jordyn's mood.\nIt was midnight in Celeste's time zone. She was already asleep when she was woken by the call. Upon seeing Jordyn's name on the screen, she was about to answer when the call abruptly disconnected.\nAlthough Celeste had written in her divorce agreement that she would relinquish custody of Jordyn, she still felt a sense of responsibility as her mother. Worried that something might have happened, Celeste immediately called back.\nWhen Jordyn saw the incoming call, she turned her head away and refused to answer.\nCeleste became more concerned and quickly called the landline at the villa.\nHannah answered promptly. After hearing Celeste's concerns, she reassured her, \"Ms. Fleming should be fine. She went to bed late last night and woke up late today. When I checked earlier, she was still asleep. I'll go upstairs to take a look and call you back.\"\nFeeling relieved, Celeste replied, \"Thank you.\"\nWhen Hannah went upstairs, Jordyn was already in the bathroom brushing her teeth.\nAfter Hannah relayed Celeste being worried about her, Jordyn lowered her head and lied, \"I accidentally hit the call button.\"\nHannah believed her and didn't doubt what she said. Seeing that Jordyn was still brushing her teeth, she went back downstairs to update Celeste that Jordyn was fine.\nJordyn watched as Hannah left. She huffed and finally felt a bit better.\nAfter hearing Hannah's reassurance, Celeste felt relieved too. Still, having been abruptly woken, she struggled to fall back asleep. She wasn't in great shape the next morning at work.\nThe envelope containing the divorce agreement was completely forgotten by Trevor after the phone call with Wynn.\nOn the day they returned to the country, Trevor packed the last document into his briefcase and ensured that nothing was left behind before heading downstairs.\n\"All set. Let's go.\"\nThe Lincoln stretch limousine departed from the villa and headed to the airport.\n\u2026\nThat night, at around 10:00 pm, the plane carrying Trevor and Jordyn landed on time. By the time they got home, it was nearly midnight. \nJordyn had fallen asleep before they arrived. When Trevor carried her upstairs, he passed the master bedroom and noticed the door was open, but the room was pitch black.\nAfter putting Jordyn on her bed and tucking her in, he returned to the master bedroom and turned on the light. Then, he glanced at the bed and found that it was empty\u2014Celeste wasn't there.\nJust then, the butler, Peter Hawk, came upstairs with his luggage. \nLoosening his tie, Trevor asked, \"Where is she?\"\nPeter replied, \"Mrs. Fleming is on a business trip.\"\nHalf a month ago, Peter hadn't been around when Celeste had left with her suitcase. The other maids told him that Celeste left with a suitcase, so he had assumed she was traveling for work.\nNow that he thought about it, this was unusual. Celeste rarely went on business trips. Even when she did, they typically lasted only two or three days.\nThis time, she had been gone for over two weeks.\n\"Alright,\" Trevor responded indifferently, asking no further questions.\n...\nThe next day, Celeste unexpectedly ran into Trevor at the company. She hadn't known that Trevor and Jordyn had returned to the country. Caught off guard by their sudden encounter, Celeste froze mid-step.\nTrevor also seemed slightly surprised to see her, but he assumed she had just returned from the business trip and didn't think much of it.\nHe passed by her coldly, his face expressionless. As usual, he treated her like she was a stranger and turned to enter the building.\nIn the past, if Celeste had found out that he'd suddenly come back, she would have been overjoyed. Even if she couldn't throw herself into his arms in such a scenario, she would have been very happy and excited. Her eyes would light up as she greeted him. \nEven if Trevor remained indifferent, she would have smiled and wished him good morning enthusiastically.\nBut now, Celeste merely glanced at his handsome face before lowering her eyes. There was no longer any trace of the joy and excitement she once felt.\nTrevor didn't notice any of this and was already walking away.\nWatching his tall and composed figure disappear into the building, Celeste wondered when he had returned. Since he was back, perhaps the matter of their divorce could soon be addressed.\nHaving resolved to go through with the divorce, Celeste didn't dwell on him further. After she returned to her workstation, she quickly immersed herself in her work.\nHalf an hour later, Zeke called her and instructed her to do something. \"Prepare two cups of coffee and take them to Mr. Fleming's office.\"\nIn the early days of her marriage, Celeste had learned that Trevor enjoyed coffee. In hopes of winning his favor, she had spent a great deal of effort studying how to brew it perfectly. Her efforts had paid off. After tasting her coffee, Trevor began to specifically request it, both at home and at the office.\nWhen she first realized he genuinely liked the coffee she made, Celeste had been thrilled. She naively believed it was the first step toward gaining his approval.\nBut she had underestimated his dislike and wariness of her. While he liked her coffee, that was all he liked. His attitude toward her remained cold and distant.\nEven when he wanted her coffee, he would have Zeke reach out to her. Once the coffee was prepared, someone else would pick it up for him. He never gave her the opportunity to approach him herself.\nOnly on rare occasions when no one else was available did she get the chance to deliver it to his office personally.\nThis time, it seemed she was to take the coffee directly to Trevor herself from Zeke's tone. After brewing the coffee, Celeste placed the cups on a tray and carried them to his office.\nThe door to his office was ajar.\nAs she approached and was about to knock on the door politely, she saw Wynn sitting on Trevor's lap. The two of them seemed to be locked in a passionate kiss.\nCeleste stopped in her tracks, her face turning pale.\nUpon seeing her, Wynn shot up from Trevor's lap, looking flustered.\nTrevor's expression darkened, and he questioned in an icy tone, \"Who allowed you to come in?\"\n..."

                  "text": "If your husband stayed cold around you, then his passion might have found someone else.\nCeleste looked into the restaurant - her husband wrapped his arms around his first love dotingly, while her daughter was giggling besides...she finally decided to let go.\nThe cheating husband, along with the daughter calling another woman \"mom\"\u2014she would throw them both out of her life!\n\nAfter seven years of marriage, my husband, Trevor, fell for another woman\u2014even our daughter wanted her as her new mom.\nI scoffed at the years I\u2019d wasted and handed him the divorce papers. Yet he dropped his usual aloofness, slamming me against the wall,\n\u201cDivorce? Not a chance.\u201d\n***\nWhen Celeste Rodriguez landed at the airport in Andostan, it was already past 9:00 pm.\nIt was her birthday. Her phone buzzed with messages from colleagues and friends\u2014but not a single one from her husband, Trevor Fleming.\nCeleste's smile faded.\nBy the time she reached the villa, it was already past 10:00 pm.\nHannah Lynd, the housekeeper looked startled. \"Mrs. Fleming... what a surprise.\"\n\"Where are Trevor and Jo?\" Celeste asked, handing over her luggage.\n\"Mr. Fleming isn\u2019t back yet. Miss Jordyn\u2019s upstairs playing.\"\nCeleste climbed the stairs. In her room, Jordyn sat in pajamas at her desk, completely absorbed.\n\"Jo?\" Celeste called.\nJordyn turned, her eyes lighting up. In a happy tone, she greeted, \"Mom!\"\nBut then she quickly got back to what she was doing earlier.\nCeleste walked over and hugged her tight, planting a kiss on her cheek. Yet the little one pushed her away and squirmed. \"Mom, I\u2019m busy.\" \nIt had been two months since Celeste last saw Jordyn. She missed her so much that no amount of kisses felt enough. She wanted to talk to Jordyn.\nShe noticed the necklace Jordyn was threading. \"Jo, are you making a seashell necklace?\"\n\"Mm-hm!\" Jordyn perked up visibly. \"Wynn's birthday is in a week. Dad and I picked and polished these ourselves. Pretty, right?\"\nCeleste\u2019s throat tightened. Jordyn didn\u2019t look up, only added brightly, \"Dad even got her a custom gift, tomorrow\u2014\"\nCeleste felt a pang in her chest and couldn't hold back anymore. \"Jo\u2026 Do you remember it's my birthday today?\"\n\"Huh?\" Jordyn glanced up briefly, then quickly looked back down at the string of beads in her hands, She complained, \"Mom, don\u2019t talk, Look, I messed up the bead order\u2014\"\nCeleste stood there in silence for a while, but Jordyn never looked back up. Finally, Celeste pursed her lips and left the room without another word.\nDownstairs, Hannah said, \"I called Mr. Fleming. He said he\u2019s busy tonight and you should rest first.\"\n\"I see.\" Celeste replied softly.\nShe hesitated, then called Trevor. It rang for a while before he answered.\nhis tone was indifferent as usual. \"I'm busy. Let's talk tomorrow\u2014\"\nA woman\u2019s voice chimed in: \"Trevor, who is it?\"\nWynn.\nCeleste gripped the phone tighter.\n\"No one important,\" Trevor answered her.\nBefore Celeste could say anything, Trevor had already hung up.\nCeleste stared at the screen. Two or three months apart, and this was all he had for her.\nAfter so many years of marriage, he\u2019d always been cold. Distant. Impatient. \nShe had got used to chasing after him, calling again, begging for time. Yet tonight, she didn\u2019t bother. \nPerhaps she was just too tired.\n\nThe next morning, Celeste thought it over and decided to call Trevor again.\nThere was a time difference of about 17 or 18 hours between Andostan and their home country. In Andostan, today was her actual birthday.\nShe didn\u2019t just come here for Jordyn. She wanted one thing: a family meal. Her only birthday wish.\nYet, Trevor didn\u2019t answer.\nA long time later, he texted: What\u2019s up?\nShe replied: Lunch today? Just the three of us.\nTrevor answered: Okay. Send the address.\nAlright, she typed back.\nThat was it. No acknowledgment. No \u201cHappy birthday.\u201d She wasn\u2019t surprised. But it still stung.\nAs she headed downstairs, she overheard Jordyn talking with Hannah.\n\"Aren't you happy that Mrs. Fleming is here, sweetie?\" Hannah asked.\n\"Dad and I promised to take Wynn to the beach tomorrow. If Mom comes, it'll be weird. She\u2019s always mean to Wynn.\"\n\"Mrs. Fleming is still your mom, sweetie. That\u2019s hurtful.\"\n\"I know, but Dad and I like Wynn more. Can't Wynn be my mom instead?\"\nCeleste froze.\nShe had raised Jordyn herself most of the time. But over the past two years, the more time Jordyn spent with Trevor, the more attached she became to him. When Trevor came to Andostan to expand his business last year, Jordyn had insisted on coming along.\nCeleste was reluctant and had hoped Jordyn would stay by her side. But she couldn't bear to see Jordyn upset, so she agreed.\nAnd now, Jordyn didn\u2019t even want her as her mom anymore.\nCeleste stood frozen in place, her face pale. To think that she had pushed aside her work to come to Andostan with the intention of spending more time with Jordyn.\nNow, it seemed unnecessary.\nShe walked back to her room, pale and quiet, then repacked the gifts she\u2019d brought.\nLater, Hannah texted: Madame, I took Jordyn out. Let me know if you need anything.\nCeleste sat on the bed, feeling hollow and lost inside. She had abandoned her work and made this trip, only to find no one wanted her here.\nHer arrival was nothing but a joke.\n\nAfter a long while, she left the villa. Aimlessly, she drove around in this foreign yet familiar country.\nBy noon, she remembered she had planned to have lunch with Trevor and Jordyn. As she recalled what she had overheard in the morning, she hesitated about whether to go home and pick up Jordyn. \nThen, a text from Trevor came: Something came up. Lunch\u2019s canceled.\nCeleste stared at it.\nShe should\u2019ve known. Trevor always canceled on her.  His work, friends, and everything else always came before her, his wife.\nOnce, she\u2019d cry. Today, she just felt\u2026 empty.\nCeleste was at an utter loss. She had come all this way excitedly only to be met with indifference from both Trevor and Jordyn.\nAimlessly, she drove around. Eventually, she found herself outside an old favorite restaurant which she and Trevor used to frequent.\nJust as she was about to walk in, she saw them.\nTrevor. Jordyn. Wynn.\nWynn sat next to Jordyn, laughing, feeding the little one the pastries she had taken a bite out of. Jordyn giggled, with her legs swinging around happily. Trevor smiled as he served food to both of them, but his gaze never left Wynn.\nWhat a happy family of three!\nSo this was his \"something came up.\"\nAnd this was the daughter she had carried for ten long months and nearly lost her life to bring into this world.\nCeleste laughed humorlessly. She stood there watching for a long time. Finally, she turned and drove away.\n\nBack at the villa, Celeste drafted the divorce agreement.\nTrevor had been her teenage dream\u2014but he had never truly seen her. If not for that one night and his grandfather Arnold Fleming\u2019s pressure, he never would\u2019ve married her. She thought loving him hard enough would be enough, but seven years proved otherwise.\nFor a long time, she felt lucky to have Jo\u2014her only source of comfort. But now, even Jo didn\u2019t seem to want her.\nThat was it.\nShe was done\u2014with the marriage, the lies, the thankless role of wife and mother. It was time to leave all this behind\u2014and reclaim the promising life she'd given up!\nShe sealed the divorce papers, handed them to Hannah, then grabbed her suitcase and walked out, bound for the airport. On the way, she finally dialed the number she\u2019d been avoiding for months.\nThe line rang once. Twice. A click.\n\u201cHello?\u201d\nShe took a breath, steady and sharp.\u201cThat offer still stand?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d\n...\nAt around 9:00 pm, Trevor and Jordyn returned home.\nJordyn clung to the hem of Trevor's coat and got out of the car sluggishly. Because Celeste was at home, she was reluctant to return that night.\nBut Wynn had said that Celeste came specifically to be with her and Trevor, and if they didn't return, she would be sad. Trevor also said that if they didn't go home that night, Celeste would definitely insist on joining them on their outing to the sea the next day.\nReluctantly, Jordyn agreed to come home.\nStill worried, she muttered gloomily, \"Dad, what if Mom insists on tagging along with us tomorrow?\"\n\"She won't,\" Trevor replied confidently.\nIn all the years they'd been married, Celeste had always tried to find ways to spend more time with him. But she was also sensible. As long as he made his stance clear, she wouldn't dare make him upset.\nIn Jordyn's memory, Celeste always listened to Trevor. Since he said she wouldn't, she felt reassured. As a result, her mood lifted. She made her way into the villa cheerfully and told Hannah she wanted to take a bath.\n\"Sure, sure,\" Hannah replied to Jordyn. Then, she remembered Celeste's instructions and handed an envelope to Trevor. \"Mr. Fleming, this is from Mrs. Fleming. She asked me to give it to you.\"\nTrevor took the envelope and asked casually, \"Where is she?\"\n\"Mrs. Fleming packed up and went back to the country this afternoon. Didn't you know?\" Hannah responded.\nTrevor paused mid-step as he was heading upstairs. He turned back, feeling a little surprised. \"Has she gone back?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nWhy had Celeste suddenly come to Andostan? Trevor hadn't given her a chance to tell him about it. He hadn't cared to ask either. Upon learning she'd left, he didn't dwell on it.\nJordyn was a little surprised too. When she heard the news, she felt a small twinge of disappointment. She'd been thinking that even if Celeste didn't join them for the outing tomorrow, it might be nice to have her around at home in the evening.\nPolishing the seashells made her hands hurt\u2014she had been counting on Celeste's help in finishing the necklace.\nThough it had been months since Trevor and Celeste had seen each other, she had made the effort to visit but only to leave without seeing him in person. Hannah recalled Celeste's grim expression as she left and thought that things felt a little off.\nShe couldn't help but say, \"Mr. Fleming, Mrs. Fleming looked upset when she left. She seemed angry.\"\nHannah had assumed Celeste's sudden departure was due to an urgent matter. Upon realizing Trevor hadn't known she'd left, she began to feel something was amiss.\n\"Angry?\" Trevor repeated in his mind. \nIn his presence, Celeste had always been patient and accommodating. So, she could get angry too? This was new.\nTrevor smiled faintly and responded to Hannah perfunctorily before heading upstairs.\nBack in the bedroom, he was about to open the envelope Celeste had left when Wynn called. After answering the call, he tossed the envelope aside and walked out the door.\nA short while later, the envelope slipped off the bed onto the floor.\nThat night, Trevor didn't return home.\nThe next day, Hannah noticed the envelope on the floor when she was cleaning. Recognizing it as the one Celeste had asked her to hand over, she assumed Trevor had already seen it and placed it in a nearby drawer.\n\u2026\nRight after getting off the plane, Celeste went home and began packing her belongings. She had accumulated quite a few things in the house since she'd been living there for six years, after all. But she only took a few sets of clothes, two sets of daily necessities, and some books that were related to her field of study back in college.\nAfter their marriage, Trevor had been depositing money for her and Jordyn into two separate accounts every month. One account was hers, and the other was Jordyn's.\nHowever, Celeste was used to spending her own money only. She had never touched the money in Jordyn's account. Because she loved Trevor, whenever she went shopping and saw clothes, shoes, cufflinks, or ties that suited him, she couldn't help but buy them.\nIn contrast, she didn't have many expenses on a daily basis because all she did was go to work. Her heart and mind were always focused on Trevor and Jordyn. She wanted to give them the best of everything.\nMost of the money Trevor deposited into her bank account was spent on him and Jordyn.\nGiven this spending pattern, there shouldn't have been much money left in Celeste's account. But over the past year, her opportunities to buy things for Trevor and Jordyn had decreased significantly because they were in Andostan.\nNow, there were over three million dollars in her account. That amount might not matter to Trevor, but to her, it was no small sum. And since it was her money, Celeste didn't hesitate to transfer it out.\nShe left both cards behind, dragged her suitcase out the door, and didn't look back.\nCeleste had an apartment near her workplace, which was a little over 1,100 square feet. She'd bought it four years ago to support a friend who had been struggling to meet their sales targets. She had never lived there before.\nNow, the apartment came in handy. She had it cleaned regularly, so it wasn't dirty. After a quick tidy-up, it was ready to move in.\nAfter a long day, Celeste washed up and went to bed around 10:00 pm.\n\u2026\nThe shrill sound of an alarm jolted Celeste awake. Startled, her mind went blank for a moment.\nWhen she came to her senses, she realized that while it was 1:00 am here, it was 7:00 am in Andostan, where Trevor and Jordyn were. This was their usual breakfast time.\nEver since Jordyn had gone to live with Trevor in Andostan, Celeste had developed the habit of calling her at this time every day. As she was always exhausted from work and was used to going to bed early, she had set this alarm to ensure she wouldn't miss the call.\nAt first, Jordyn hadn't adapted well to living in Andostan and had missed her terribly. She had called Celeste constantly. But as time went on, the calls that used to be full of yearning and dependence had grown perfunctory and impatient.\nThe alarm was no longer necessary. She just hadn't been able to let go.\nSmiling bitterly, Celeste deleted the alarm and turned off her phone before going back to sleep.\n\u2026\nMeanwhile, Trevor and Jordyn were nearly done with breakfast. Though he knew Celeste usually called Jordyn at this time, he wasn't always home and hadn't paid much attention to the routine.\nHe noticed that Celeste hadn't called that day. The fact registered in his mind, but he didn't care. After finishing breakfast, he went upstairs to change.\nJordyn, finding Celeste increasingly annoying, had grown less fond of their calls. Upon realizing that Celeste hadn't called yet, she figured something must have come up.\nShe grabbed her backpack and bolted for the door.\nHannah hurried after her. \"Ms. Fleming, it's still early. There's no rush!\"\nJordyn ignored her and ran to the car happily. She was thrilled that Celeste hadn't called on time that day. If she stayed home, she might still have to talk to Celeste later. Well, she didn't want that!\n\u2026\nAfter getting married to Trevor, Celeste had joined Fleming Group for his sake. Now that she was planning to divorce him, she saw no reason to stay.\nThe next morning, Celeste handed her resignation letter to Zeke Jackson after arriving at the office.\nZeke was one of Trevor's personal secretaries. When he saw Celeste's resignation letter, he was extremely surprised.\nHe was one of the few in the company who knew about the relationship between Celeste and Trevor.\nAnyone familiar with Trevor knew that he didn't love Celeste. So, he had been cold to her and rarely went home after their marriage.\nTo get closer to and win over Trevor, Celeste had chosen to work at Fleming Group.\nHer initial goal was to become his personal secretary, but Trevor refused vehemently. Even when Arnold stepped in, he couldn't get Trevor to agree. In the end, Celeste had to settle for a position in the secretarial team, becoming one of Trevor's many ordinary secretaries.\nAt first, Zeke had worried that Celeste's presence in the secretarial team would create chaos. But to his surprise, she didn't bring them any trouble. Although Celeste used her position to get closer to Trevor, she was mindful of her timing and never overstepped her boundaries. \nOn the contrary, she worked diligently and performed exceptionally well, hoping to gain Trevor's respect. Whether during her pregnancy, childbirth, or any other time, she strictly adhered to company policies and never sought special treatment.\nOver the years, Celeste rose to become the head of the secretarial team. Zeke had observed her feelings for Trevor from the sidelines all the while. To be honest, he had never imagined she would resign one day. He felt skeptical about her willingly giving up her position.\nSomething must have happened between Celeste and Trevor for her to resign now. Zeke understood that this was something he wasn't privy to\u2014it must be something significant enough for Trevor to have ordered her to resign.\nWhile he found it a pity, Zeke maintained a professional tone. \"I acknowledge that I've received your resignation letter. I'll arrange for someone to take over your duties as soon as possible.\"\n\"Alright.\" Celeste nodded and returned to her workstation.\nAfter working for a while, Zeke started an online meeting with Trevor to report on company matters. As the conversation neared its end, he suddenly remembered Celeste's resignation. \n\"Oh, Mr. Fleming, there's one more thing\u2014\"\nAlthough Zeke had told Celeste he would quickly arrange for someone to take over her position, he wanted to gauge Trevor's thoughts on the matter first. If Trevor wanted Celeste out immediately, he would make the arrangements right away.\nBut as the words left his mouth, he remembered that when Celeste first joined the company, Trevor had explicitly stated that all matters regarding her employment should be handled per company regulations. He made it clear that there was no need to report anything to him since he wouldn't concern himself with her.\nAnd indeed, over the years, Trevor had never actively inquired about Celeste's work at the company.\nEven when he encountered her at work, he treated her like she was a complete stranger.\nWhen Celeste was set to be promoted a couple of years ago, the team had hesitated. Everyone was aware of Trevor's dislike for her. They had even brought it up with him to gauge his opinion back then.\nTrevor had frowned in annoyance and reiterated that he wouldn't interfere and that they should handle it according to company policy. He had emphasized that they shouldn't bring up Celeste's matters with him again.\nSeeing Zeke's hesitation, Trevor frowned. \"What is it?\"\nZeke snapped out of his thoughts and quickly replied, \"Oh, it's nothing.\"\nSince Trevor was already aware of Celeste's resignation but hadn't brought it up, it was clear that this matter wasn't important to him. So, Zeke decided to proceed as usual and handle the matter according to company regulations.\nWith that resolved, Trevor ended the call.\n\u2026\n\"What are you thinking about?\" At noon, a colleague patted Celeste on the shoulder.\nCeleste came back to her senses and smiled, shaking her head. \"Nothing.\"\n\"Don't you need to call your daughter today?\"\n\"No, not today.\"\nTypically, she called Jordyn twice a day\u2014once at 1:00 am and once at around 12:00 pm.\nHer colleagues at work were aware of this habit. What they didn't know was her daughter was the child she had with the company's CEO.\nAfter work, Celeste went to the supermarket. She bought some groceries and a few potted plants before heading home.\nAfter dinner, she browsed online for information about the upcoming technology exhibition. \nAfter that, she made a call. \"Please reserve a ticket for next month's tech exhibition for me.\"\n\"Are you sure?\" the person on the other end replied coolly. \"The last two times you asked me to reserve tickets, you didn't show up. Do you know how many people's lifelong dream is to get one of those tickets? You wasted them thoughtlessly.\"\nThe annual tech exhibition was a major event in the industry, and tickets were not easily obtainable.\nTheir company had a limited number of slots, and many IT elites working for them eagerly vied for the opportunity to attend it.\n\"If I don't show up to the exhibition this time, I will never ask you to reserve a ticket for me ever again,\" Celeste promised.\nThere was silence on the other end before the line disconnected. \nCeleste knew that he'd agreed. The corners of her mouth tugged upward into a smile. What she hadn't said was that she wanted to return to the company.\nThough she was one of the partners of her tech firm, she had stepped back during its early days to focus on marriage and family. Her decision had disrupted their development plans and cost them many opportunities.\nHer colleagues had been both angry and frustrated with her. Over the years, they had rarely been in contact.\nWhile Celeste was eager to return, she knew she had been out of the industry for too long. If she went back unprepared, she was worried she wouldn't be able to keep up with the company's current pace.\nSo, she planned to spend some time familiarizing herself with the industry's latest developments before making a concrete decision.\nFor the next few days, Celeste focused on her work during office hours and spent her evenings tending to her own matters. She didn't reach out to Jordyn or Trevor, and they didn't contact her either.\nCeleste wasn't surprised. For over half a year, her communication with them had been one-sided. They had only passively responded to her efforts.\n\u2026\nMeanwhile, in Andostan, Jordyn had developed the habit of calling Wynn first thing every morning.\nThat day, she called Wynn right after waking up as usual. However, the call didn't last long before she burst into tears.\nWynn had told her some bad news. \"I'm going back to the country soon.\"\nDevastated, Jordyn finished the call and immediately phoned Trevor. \"Dad, did you know about this?\"\nAt his office, Trevor flipped through some documents. \"Yes.\"\n\"When did you find out?\"\n\"It's been a while.\"\n\"Dad, you're so mean\u2026\" Jordyn hugged her pink stuffed pig and cried loudly. \"I don't want Wynn to leave. If she's not here, I don't want to go to school here anymore. I want to go back too!\"\nTrevor's tone remained even. \"It's already being arranged.\"\nJordyn didn't understand. \"W-What do you mean?\"\n\"We're going back next week.\"\nJordyn jumped out of bed in excitement. \"Really?\"\n\"Yes, really,\" Trevor replied.\n\"Then why didn't Wynn tell me just now?\"\n\"It was just finalized. She doesn't know yet.\"\nJordyn was ecstatic. \"Dad, let's keep this a secret from Wynn. We'll surprise her when we go back to the country, okay?\"\n\"Alright.\"\n\"You're the best, Dad! I love you so much!\"\nAfter hanging up, Jordyn was still overjoyed. She sang and danced on her bed.\nAfter a while, she suddenly thought of Celeste. For the past few days, she had been in a great mood because Celeste hadn't called her. In fact, to avoid talking to Celeste, she had deliberately left home early and even turned off her phone or kept it far away from her after school.\nBut after two days, she was worried that Celeste might get angry if she found out. So, she stopped doing that. To her surprise, Celeste hadn't called at all in the days that followed.\nAt first, she thought Celeste had discovered that she was deliberately avoiding her calls. But then she remembered that based on past experiences, that wasn't very likely. If Celeste knew she had done something wrong, she would immediately ask Jordyn to correct her wrongdoing instead of sulking and not calling.\nAfter all, she was the most important person to Celeste. Jordyn knew that Celeste loved her the most, so she didn't think that Celeste would purposely refrain from calling her simply because she was upset.\nAs Jordyn thought about this, she suddenly missed Celeste. It was the first time in days she had thought about Celeste, and she couldn't resist dialing Celeste's number.\nBut just as the call connected, she remembered that while she would get to see Wynn after returning to the country, Celeste would undoubtedly try every possible way to prevent her from meeting Wynn. She wouldn't be able to see Wynn whenever she wanted like she could now.\nThis thought dampened Jordyn's mood.\nIt was midnight in Celeste's time zone. She was already asleep when she was woken by the call. Upon seeing Jordyn's name on the screen, she was about to answer when the call abruptly disconnected.\nAlthough Celeste had written in her divorce agreement that she would relinquish custody of Jordyn, she still felt a sense of responsibility as her mother. Worried that something might have happened, Celeste immediately called back.\nWhen Jordyn saw the incoming call, she turned her head away and refused to answer.\nCeleste became more concerned and quickly called the landline at the villa.\nHannah answered promptly. After hearing Celeste's concerns, she reassured her, \"Ms. Fleming should be fine. She went to bed late last night and woke up late today. When I checked earlier, she was still asleep. I'll go upstairs to take a look and call you back.\"\nFeeling relieved, Celeste replied, \"Thank you.\"\nWhen Hannah went upstairs, Jordyn was already in the bathroom brushing her teeth.\nAfter Hannah relayed Celeste being worried about her, Jordyn lowered her head and lied, \"I accidentally hit the call button.\"\nHannah believed her and didn't doubt what she said. Seeing that Jordyn was still brushing her teeth, she went back downstairs to update Celeste that Jordyn was fine.\nJordyn watched as Hannah left. She huffed and finally felt a bit better.\nAfter hearing Hannah's reassurance, Celeste felt relieved too. Still, having been abruptly woken, she struggled to fall back asleep. She wasn't in great shape the next morning at work.\nThe envelope containing the divorce agreement was completely forgotten by Trevor after the phone call with Wynn.\nOn the day they returned to the country, Trevor packed the last document into his briefcase and ensured that nothing was left behind before heading downstairs.\n\"All set. Let's go.\"\nThe Lincoln stretch limousine departed from the villa and headed to the airport.\n\u2026\nThat night, at around 10:00 pm, the plane carrying Trevor and Jordyn landed on time. By the time they got home, it was nearly midnight. \nJordyn had fallen asleep before they arrived. When Trevor carried her upstairs, he passed the master bedroom and noticed the door was open, but the room was pitch black.\nAfter putting Jordyn on her bed and tucking her in, he returned to the master bedroom and turned on the light. Then, he glanced at the bed and found that it was empty\u2014Celeste wasn't there.\nJust then, the butler, Peter Hawk, came upstairs with his luggage. \nLoosening his tie, Trevor asked, \"Where is she?\"\nPeter replied, \"Mrs. Fleming is on a business trip.\"\nHalf a month ago, Peter hadn't been around when Celeste had left with her suitcase. The other maids told him that Celeste left with a suitcase, so he had assumed she was traveling for work.\nNow that he thought about it, this was unusual. Celeste rarely went on business trips. Even when she did, they typically lasted only two or three days.\nThis time, she had been gone for over two weeks.\n\"Alright,\" Trevor responded indifferently, asking no further questions.\n...\nThe next day, Celeste unexpectedly ran into Trevor at the company. She hadn't known that Trevor and Jordyn had returned to the country. Caught off guard by their sudden encounter, Celeste froze mid-step.\nTrevor also seemed slightly surprised to see her, but he assumed she had just returned from the business trip and didn't think much of it.\nHe passed by her coldly, his face expressionless. As usual, he treated her like she was a stranger and turned to enter the building.\nIn the past, if Celeste had found out that he'd suddenly come back, she would have been overjoyed. Even if she couldn't throw herself into his arms in such a scenario, she would have been very happy and excited. Her eyes would light up as she greeted him. \nEven if Trevor remained indifferent, she would have smiled and wished him good morning enthusiastically.\nBut now, Celeste merely glanced at his handsome face before lowering her eyes. There was no longer any trace of the joy and excitement she once felt.\nTrevor didn't notice any of this and was already walking away.\nWatching his tall and composed figure disappear into the building, Celeste wondered when he had returned. Since he was back, perhaps the matter of their divorce could soon be addressed.\nHaving resolved to go through with the divorce, Celeste didn't dwell on him further. After she returned to her workstation, she quickly immersed herself in her work.\nHalf an hour later, Zeke called her and instructed her to do something. \"Prepare two cups of coffee and take them to Mr. Fleming's office.\"\nIn the early days of her marriage, Celeste had learned that Trevor enjoyed coffee. In hopes of winning his favor, she had spent a great deal of effort studying how to brew it perfectly. Her efforts had paid off. After tasting her coffee, Trevor began to specifically request it, both at home and at the office.\nWhen she first realized he genuinely liked the coffee she made, Celeste had been thrilled. She naively believed it was the first step toward gaining his approval.\nBut she had underestimated his dislike and wariness of her. While he liked her coffee, that was all he liked. His attitude toward her remained cold and distant.\nEven when he wanted her coffee, he would have Zeke reach out to her. Once the coffee was prepared, someone else would pick it up for him. He never gave her the opportunity to approach him herself.\nOnly on rare occasions when no one else was available did she get the chance to deliver it to his office personally.\nThis time, it seemed she was to take the coffee directly to Trevor herself from Zeke's tone. After brewing the coffee, Celeste placed the cups on a tray and carried them to his office.\nThe door to his office was ajar.\nAs she approached and was about to knock on the door politely, she saw Wynn sitting on Trevor's lap. The two of them seemed to be locked in a passionate kiss.\nCeleste stopped in her tracks, her face turning pale.\nUpon seeing her, Wynn shot up from Trevor's lap, looking flustered.\nTrevor's expression darkened, and he questioned in an icy tone, \"Who allowed you to come in?\"\n..."

Yet he dropped his usual aloofness, slamming me against the wall,\n\u201cDivorce? Not a chance.\u201d\n***\nWhen Celeste Rodriguez landed at the airport in Andostan, it was already past 9:00 pm.\nIt was her birthday. Her phone buzzed with messages from colleagues and friends\u2014but not a single one from her husband, Trevor Fleming.\nCeleste's smile faded.\nBy the time she reached the villa, it was already past 10:00 pm.\nHannah Lynd, the housekeeper looked startled. \"Mrs. Fleming... what a surprise.\"\n\"Where are Trevor and Jo?\" Celeste asked, handing over her luggage.\n\"Mr. Fleming isn\u2019t back yet. Miss Jordyn\u2019s upstairs playing.\"\nCeleste climbed the stairs. In her room, Jordyn sat in pajamas at her desk, completely absorbed.\n\"Jo?\" Celeste called.\nJordyn turned, her eyes lighting up. In a happy tone, she greeted, \"Mom!\"\nBut then she quickly got back to what she was doing earlier.\nCeleste walked over and hugged her tight, planting a kiss on her cheek. Yet the little one pushed her away and squirmed. \"Mom, I\u2019m busy.\" \nIt had been two months since Celeste last saw Jordyn. She missed her so much that no amount of kisses felt enough. She wanted to talk to Jordyn.\nShe noticed the necklace Jordyn was threading. \"Jo, are you making a seashell necklace?\"\n\"Mm-hm!\" Jordyn perked up visibly. \"Wynn's birthday is in a week. Dad and I picked and polished these ourselves. Pretty, right?\"\nCeleste\u2019s throat tightened. Jordyn didn\u2019t look up, only added brightly, \"Dad even got her a custom gift, tomorrow\u2014\"\nCeleste felt a pang in her chest and couldn't hold back anymore. \"Jo\u2026 Do you remember it's my birthday today?\"\n\"Huh?\" Jordyn glanced up briefly, then quickly looked back down at the string of beads in her hands, She complained, \"Mom, don\u2019t talk, Look, I messed up the bead order\u2014\"\nCeleste stood there in silence for a while, but Jordyn never looked back up. Finally, Celeste pursed her lips and left the room without another word.\nDownstairs, Hannah said, \"I called Mr. Fleming. He said he\u2019s busy tonight and you should rest first.\"\n\"I see.\" Celeste replied softly.\nShe hesitated, then called Trevor. It rang for a while before he answered.\nhis tone was indifferent as usual. \"I'm busy. Let's talk tomorrow\u2014\"\nA woman\u2019s voice chimed in: \"Trevor, who is it?\"\nWynn.\nCeleste gripped the phone tighter.\n\"No one important,\" Trevor answered her.\nBefore Celeste could say anything, Trevor had already hung up.\nCeleste stared at the screen. Two or three months apart, and this was all he had for her.\nAfter so many years of marriage, he\u2019d always been cold. Distant. Impatient. \nShe had got used to chasing after him, calling again, begging for time. Yet tonight, she didn\u2019t bother. \nPerhaps she was just too tired.\n\nThe next morning, Celeste thought it over and decided to call Trevor again.\nThere was a time difference of about 17 or 18 hours between Andostan and their home country. In Andostan, today was her actual birthday.\nShe didn\u2019t just come here for Jordyn. She wanted one thing: a family meal. Her only birthday wish.\nYet, Trevor didn\u2019t answer.\nA long time later, he texted: What\u2019s up?\nShe replied: Lunch today? Just the three of us.\nTrevor answered: Okay. Send the address.\nAlright, she typed back.\nThat was it. No acknowledgment. No \u201cHappy birthday.\u201d She wasn\u2019t surprised. But it still stung.\nAs she headed downstairs, she overheard Jordyn talking with Hannah.\n\"Aren't you happy that Mrs. Fleming is here, sweetie?\" Hannah asked.\n\"Dad and I promised to take Wynn to the beach tomorrow. If Mom comes, it'll be weird. She\u2019s always mean to Wynn.\"\n\"Mrs. Fleming is still your mom, sweetie. That\u2019s hurtful.\"\n\"I know, but Dad and I like Wynn more. Can't Wynn be my mom instead?\"\nCeleste froze.\nShe had raised Jordyn herself most of the time. But over the past two years, the more time Jordyn spent with Trevor, the more attached she became to him. When Trevor came to Andostan to expand his business last year, Jordyn had insisted on coming along.\nCeleste was reluctant and had hoped Jordyn would stay by her side. But she couldn't bear to see Jordyn upset, so she agreed.\nAnd now, Jordyn didn\u2019t even want her as her mom anymore.\nCeleste stood frozen in place, her face pale. To think that she had pushed aside her work to come to Andostan with the intention of spending more time with Jordyn.\nNow, it seemed unnecessary.\nShe walked back to her room, pale and quiet, then repacked the gifts she\u2019d brought.\nLater, Hannah texted: Madame, I took Jordyn out. Let me know if you need anything.\nCeleste sat on the bed, feeling hollow and lost inside. She had abandoned her work and made this trip, only to find no one wanted her here.\nHer arrival was nothing but a joke.\n\nAfter a long while, she left the villa. Aimlessly, she drove around in this foreign yet familiar country.\nBy noon, she remembered she had planned to have lunch with Trevor and Jordyn. As she recalled what she had overheard in the morning, she hesitated about whether to go home and pick up Jordyn. \nThen, a text from Trevor came: Something came up. Lunch\u2019s canceled.\nCeleste stared at it.\nShe should\u2019ve known. Trevor always canceled on her.  His work, friends, and everything else always came before her, his wife.\nOnce, she\u2019d cry. Today, she just felt\u2026 empty.\nCeleste was at an utter loss. She had come all this way excitedly only to be met with indifference from both Trevor and Jordyn.\nAimlessly, she drove around. Eventually, she found herself outside an old favorite restaurant which she and Trevor used to frequent.\nJust as she was about to walk in, she saw them.\nTrevor. Jordyn. Wynn.\nWynn sat next to Jordyn, laughing, feeding the little one the pastries she had taken a bite out of. Jordyn giggled, with her legs swinging around happily. Trevor smiled as he served food to both of them, but his gaze never left Wynn.\nWhat a happy family of three!\nSo this was his \"something came up.\"\nAnd this was the daughter she had carried for ten long months and nearly lost her life to bring into this world.\nCeleste laughed humorlessly. She stood there watching for a long time. Finally, she turned and drove away.\n\nBack at the villa, Celeste drafted the divorce agreement.\nTrevor had been her teenage dream\u2014but he had never truly seen her. If not for that one night and his grandfather Arnold Fleming\u2019s pressure, he never would\u2019ve married her. She thought loving him hard enough would be enough, but seven years proved otherwise.\nFor a long time, she felt lucky to have Jo\u2014her only source of comfort. But now, even Jo didn\u2019t seem to want her.\nThat was it.\nShe was done\u2014with the marriage, the lies, the thankless role of wife and mother. It was time to leave all this behind\u2014and reclaim the promising life she'd given up!\nShe sealed the divorce papers, handed them to Hannah, then grabbed her suitcase and walked out, bound for the airport. On the way, she finally dialed the number she\u2019d been avoiding for months.\nThe line rang once. Twice. A click.\n\u201cHello?\u201d\nShe took a breath, steady and sharp.\u201cThat offer still stand?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d\n...\nAt around 9:00 pm, Trevor and Jordyn returned home.\nJordyn clung to the hem of Trevor's coat and got out of the car sluggishly. Because Celeste was at home, she was reluctant to return that night.\nBut Wynn had said that Celeste came specifically to be with her and Trevor, and if they didn't return, she would be sad. Trevor also said that if they didn't go home that night, Celeste would definitely insist on joining them on their outing to the sea the next day.\nReluctantly, Jordyn agreed to come home.\nStill worried, she muttered gloomily, \"Dad, what if Mom insists on tagging along with us tomorrow?\"\n\"She won't,\" Trevor replied confidently.\nIn all the years they'd been married, Celeste had always tried to find ways to spend more time with him. But she was also sensible. As long as he made his stance clear, she wouldn't dare make him upset.\nIn Jordyn's memory, Celeste always listened to Trevor. Since he said she wouldn't, she felt reassured. As a result, her mood lifted. She made her way into the villa cheerfully and told Hannah she wanted to take a bath.\n\"Sure, sure,\" Hannah replied to Jordyn. Then, she remembered Celeste's instructions and handed an envelope to Trevor. \"Mr. Fleming, this is from Mrs. Fleming. She asked me to give it to you.\"\nTrevor took the envelope and asked casually, \"Where is she?\"\n\"Mrs. Fleming packed up and went back to the country this afternoon. Didn't you know?\" Hannah responded.\nTrevor paused mid-step as he was heading upstairs. He turned back, feeling a little surprised. \"Has she gone back?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nWhy had Celeste suddenly come to Andostan? Trevor hadn't given her a chance to tell him about it. He hadn't cared to ask either. Upon learning she'd left, he didn't dwell on it.\nJordyn was a little surprised too. When she heard the news, she felt a small twinge of disappointment. She'd been thinking that even if Celeste didn't join them for the outing tomorrow, it might be nice to have her around at home in the evening.\nPolishing the seashells made her hands hurt\u2014she had been counting on Celeste's help in finishing the necklace.\nThough it had been months since Trevor and Celeste had seen each other, she had made the effort to visit but only to leave without seeing him in person. Hannah recalled Celeste's grim expression as she left and thought that things felt a little off.\nShe couldn't help but say, \"Mr. Fleming, Mrs. Fleming looked upset when she left. She seemed angry.\"\nHannah had assumed Celeste's sudden departure was due to an urgent matter. Upon realizing Trevor hadn't known she'd left, she began to feel something was amiss.\n\"Angry?\" Trevor repeated in his mind. \nIn his presence, Celeste had always been patient and accommodating. So, she could get angry too? This was new.\nTrevor smiled faintly and responded to Hannah perfunctorily before heading upstairs.\nBack in the bedroom, he was about to open the envelope Celeste had left when Wynn called. After answering the call, he tossed the envelope aside and walked out the door.\nA short while later, the envelope slipped off the bed onto the floor.\nThat night, Trevor didn't return home.\nThe next day, Hannah noticed the envelope on the floor when she was cleaning. Recognizing it as the one Celeste had asked her to hand over, she assumed Trevor had already seen it and placed it in a nearby drawer.\n\u2026\nRight after getting off the plane, Celeste went home and began packing her belongings. She had accumulated quite a few things in the house since she'd been living there for six years, after all. But she only took a few sets of clothes, two sets of daily necessities, and some books that were related to her field of study back in college.\nAfter their marriage, Trevor had been depositing money for her and Jordyn into two separate accounts every month. One account was hers, and the other was Jordyn's.\nHowever, Celeste was used to spending her own money only. She had never touched the money in Jordyn's account. Because she loved Trevor, whenever she went shopping and saw clothes, shoes, cufflinks, or ties that suited him, she couldn't help but buy them.\nIn contrast, she didn't have many expenses on a daily basis because all she did was go to work. Her heart and mind were always focused on Trevor and Jordyn. She wanted to give them the best of everything.\nMost of the money Trevor deposited into her bank account was spent on him and Jordyn.\nGiven this spending pattern, there shouldn't have been much money left in Celeste's account. But over the past year, her opportunities to buy things for Trevor and Jordyn had decreased significantly because they were in Andostan.\nNow, there were over three million dollars in her account. That amount might not matter to Trevor, but to her, it was no small sum. And since it was her money, Celeste didn't hesitate to transfer it out.\nShe left both cards behind, dragged her suitcase out the door, and didn't look back.\nCeleste had an apartment near her workplace, which was a little over 1,100 square feet. She'd bought it four years ago to support a friend who had been struggling to meet their sales targets. She had never lived there before.\nNow, the apartment came in handy. She had it cleaned regularly, so it wasn't dirty. After a quick tidy-up, it was ready to move in.\nAfter a long day, Celeste washed up and went to bed around 10:00 pm.\n\u2026\nThe shrill sound of an alarm jolted Celeste awake. Startled, her mind went blank for a moment.\nWhen she came to her senses, she realized that while it was 1:00 am here, it was 7:00 am in Andostan, where Trevor and Jordyn were. This was their usual breakfast time.\nEver since Jordyn had gone to live with Trevor in Andostan, Celeste had developed the habit of calling her at this time every day. As she was always exhausted from work and was used to going to bed early, she had set this alarm to ensure she wouldn't miss the call.\nAt first, Jordyn hadn't adapted well to living in Andostan and had missed her terribly. She had called Celeste constantly. But as time went on, the calls that used to be full of yearning and dependence had grown perfunctory and impatient.\nThe alarm was no longer necessary. She just hadn't been able to let go.\nSmiling bitterly, Celeste deleted the alarm and turned off her phone before going back to sleep.\n\u2026\nMeanwhile, Trevor and Jordyn were nearly done with breakfast. Though he knew Celeste usually called Jordyn at this time, he wasn't always home and hadn't paid much attention to the routine.\nHe noticed that Celeste hadn't called that day. The fact registered in his mind, but he didn't care. After finishing breakfast, he went upstairs to change.\nJordyn, finding Celeste increasingly annoying, had grown less fond of their calls. Upon realizing that Celeste hadn't called yet, she figured something must have come up.\nShe grabbed her backpack and bolted for the door.\nHannah hurried after her. \"Ms. Fleming, it's still early. There's no rush!\"\nJordyn ignored her and ran to the car happily. She was thrilled that Celeste hadn't called on time that day. If she stayed home, she might still have to talk to Celeste later. Well, she didn't want that!\n\u2026\nAfter getting married to Trevor, Celeste had joined Fleming Group for his sake. Now that she was planning to divorce him, she saw no reason to stay.\nThe next morning, Celeste handed her resignation letter to Zeke Jackson after arriving at the office.\nZeke was one of Trevor's personal secretaries. When he saw Celeste's resignation letter, he was extremely surprised.\nHe was one of the few in the company who knew about the relationship between Celeste and Trevor.\nAnyone familiar with Trevor knew that he didn't love Celeste. So, he had been cold to her and rarely went home after their marriage.\nTo get closer to and win over Trevor, Celeste had chosen to work at Fleming Group.\nHer initial goal was to become his personal secretary, but Trevor refused vehemently. Even when Arnold stepped in, he couldn't get Trevor to agree. In the end, Celeste had to settle for a position in the secretarial team, becoming one of Trevor's many ordinary secretaries.\nAt first, Zeke had worried that Celeste's presence in the secretarial team would create chaos. But to his surprise, she didn't bring them any trouble. Although Celeste used her position to get closer to Trevor, she was mindful of her timing and never overstepped her boundaries. \nOn the contrary, she worked diligently and performed exceptionally well, hoping to gain Trevor's respect. Whether during her pregnancy, childbirth, or any other time, she strictly adhered to company policies and never sought special treatment.\nOver the years, Celeste rose to become the head of the secretarial team. Zeke had observed her feelings for Trevor from the sidelines all the while. To be honest, he had never imagined she would resign one day. He felt skeptical about her willingly giving up her position.\nSomething must have happened between Celeste and Trevor for her to resign now. Zeke understood that this was something he wasn't privy to\u2014it must be something significant enough for Trevor to have ordered her to resign.\nWhile he found it a pity, Zeke maintained a professional tone. \"I acknowledge that I've received your resignation letter. I'll arrange for someone to take over your duties as soon as possible.\"\n\"Alright.\" Celeste nodded and returned to her workstation.\nAfter working for a while, Zeke started an online meeting with Trevor to report on company matters. As the conversation neared its end, he suddenly remembered Celeste's resignation. \n\"Oh, Mr. Fleming, there's one more thing\u2014\"\nAlthough Zeke had told Celeste he would quickly arrange for someone to take over her position, he wanted to gauge Trevor's thoughts on the matter first. If Trevor wanted Celeste out immediately, he would make the arrangements right away.\nBut as the words left his mouth, he remembered that when Celeste first joined the company, Trevor had explicitly stated that all matters regarding her employment should be handled per company regulations. He made it clear that there was no need to report anything to him since he wouldn't concern himself with her.\nAnd indeed, over the years, Trevor had never actively inquired about Celeste's work at the company.\nEven when he encountered her at work, he treated her like she was a complete stranger.\nWhen Celeste was set to be promoted a couple of years ago, the team had hesitated. Everyone was aware of Trevor's dislike for her. They had even brought it up with him to gauge his opinion back then.\nTrevor had frowned in annoyance and reiterated that he wouldn't interfere and that they should handle it according to company policy. He had emphasized that they shouldn't bring up Celeste's matters with him again.\nSeeing Zeke's hesitation, Trevor frowned. \"What is it?\"\nZeke snapped out of his thoughts and quickly replied, \"Oh, it's nothing.\"\nSince Trevor was already aware of Celeste's resignation but hadn't brought it up, it was clear that this matter wasn't important to him. So, Zeke decided to proceed as usual and handle the matter according to company regulations.\nWith that resolved, Trevor ended the call.\n\u2026\n\"What are you thinking about?\" At noon, a colleague patted Celeste on the shoulder.\nCeleste came back to her senses and smiled, shaking her head. \"Nothing.\"\n\"Don't you need to call your daughter today?\"\n\"No, not today.\"\nTypically, she called Jordyn twice a day\u2014once at 1:00 am and once at around 12:00 pm.\nHer colleagues at work were aware of this habit. What they didn't know was her daughter was the child she had with the company's CEO.\nAfter work, Celeste went to the supermarket. She bought some groceries and a few potted plants before heading home.\nAfter dinner, she browsed online for information about the upcoming technology exhibition. \nAfter that, she made a call. \"Please reserve a ticket for next month's tech exhibition for me.\"\n\"Are you sure?\" the person on the other end replied coolly. \"The last two times you asked me to reserve tickets, you didn't show up. Do you know how many people's lifelong dream is to get one of those tickets? You wasted them thoughtlessly.\"\nThe annual tech exhibition was a major event in the industry, and tickets were not easily obtainable.\nTheir company had a limited number of slots, and many IT elites working for them eagerly vied for the opportunity to attend it.\n\"If I don't show up to the exhibition this time, I will never ask you to reserve a ticket for me ever again,\" Celeste promised.\nThere was silence on the other end before the line disconnected. \nCeleste knew that he'd agreed. The corners of her mouth tugged upward into a smile. What she hadn't said was that she wanted to return to the company.\nThough she was one of the partners of her tech firm, she had stepped back during its early days to focus on marriage and family. Her decision had disrupted their development plans and cost them many opportunities.\nHer colleagues had been both angry and frustrated with her. Over the years, they had rarely been in contact.\nWhile Celeste was eager to return, she knew she had been out of the industry for too long. If she went back unprepared, she was worried she wouldn't be able to keep up with the company's current pace.\nSo, she planned to spend some time familiarizing herself with the industry's latest developments before making a concrete decision.\nFor the next few days, Celeste focused on her work during office hours and spent her evenings tending to her own matters. She didn't reach out to Jordyn or Trevor, and they didn't contact her either.\nCeleste wasn't surprised. For over half a year, her communication with them had been one-sided. They had only passively responded to her efforts.\n\u2026\nMeanwhile, in Andostan, Jordyn had developed the habit of calling Wynn first thing every morning.\nThat day, she called Wynn right after waking up as usual. However, the call didn't last long before she burst into tears.\nWynn had told her some bad news. \"I'm going back to the country soon.\"\nDevastated, Jordyn finished the call and immediately phoned Trevor. \"Dad, did you know about this?\"\nAt his office, Trevor flipped through some documents. \"Yes.\"\n\"When did you find out?\"\n\"It's been a while.\"\n\"Dad, you're so mean\u2026\" Jordyn hugged her pink stuffed pig and cried loudly. \"I don't want Wynn to leave. If she's not here, I don't want to go to school here anymore. I want to go back too!\"\nTrevor's tone remained even. \"It's already being arranged.\"\nJordyn didn't understand. \"W-What do you mean?\"\n\"We're going back next week.\"\nJordyn jumped out of bed in excitement. \"Really?\"\n\"Yes, really,\" Trevor replied.\n\"Then why didn't Wynn tell me just now?\"\n\"It was just finalized. She doesn't know yet.\"\nJordyn was ecstatic. \"Dad, let's keep this a secret from Wynn. We'll surprise her when we go back to the country, okay?\"\n\"Alright.\"\n\"You're the best, Dad! I love you so much!\"\nAfter hanging up, Jordyn was still overjoyed. She sang and danced on her bed.\nAfter a while, she suddenly thought of Celeste. For the past few days, she had been in a great mood because Celeste hadn't called her. In fact, to avoid talking to Celeste, she had deliberately left home early and even turned off her phone or kept it far away from her after school.\nBut after two days, she was worried that Celeste might get angry if she found out. So, she stopped doing that. To her surprise, Celeste hadn't called at all in the days that followed.\nAt first, she thought Celeste had discovered that she was deliberately avoiding her calls. But then she remembered that based on past experiences, that wasn't very likely. If Celeste knew she had done something wrong, she would immediately ask Jordyn to correct her wrongdoing instead of sulking and not calling.\nAfter all, she was the most important person to Celeste. Jordyn knew that Celeste loved her the most, so she didn't think that Celeste would purposely refrain from calling her simply because she was upset.\nAs Jordyn thought about this, she suddenly missed Celeste. It was the first time in days she had thought about Celeste, and she couldn't resist dialing Celeste's number.\nBut just as the call connected, she remembered that while she would get to see Wynn after returning to the country, Celeste would undoubtedly try every possible way to prevent her from meeting Wynn. She wouldn't be able to see Wynn whenever she wanted like she could now.\nThis thought dampened Jordyn's mood.\nIt was midnight in Celeste's time zone. She was already asleep when she was woken by the call. Upon seeing Jordyn's name on the screen, she was about to answer when the call abruptly disconnected.\nAlthough Celeste had written in her divorce agreement that she would relinquish custody of Jordyn, she still felt a sense of responsibility as her mother. Worried that something might have happened, Celeste immediately called back.\nWhen Jordyn saw the incoming call, she turned her head away and refused to answer.\nCeleste became more concerned and quickly called the landline at the villa.\nHannah answered promptly. After hearing Celeste's concerns, she reassured her, \"Ms. Fleming should be fine. She went to bed late last night and woke up late today. When I checked earlier, she was still asleep. I'll go upstairs to take a look and call you back.\"\nFeeling relieved, Celeste replied, \"Thank you.\"\nWhen Hannah went upstairs, Jordyn was already in the bathroom brushing her teeth.\nAfter Hannah relayed Celeste being worried about her, Jordyn lowered her head and lied, \"I accidentally hit the call button.\"\nHannah believed her and didn't doubt what she said. Seeing that Jordyn was still brushing her teeth, she went back downstairs to update Celeste that Jordyn was fine.\nJordyn watched as Hannah left. She huffed and finally felt a bit better.\nAfter hearing Hannah's reassurance, Celeste felt relieved too. Still, having been abruptly woken, she struggled to fall back asleep. She wasn't in great shape the next morning at work.\nThe envelope containing the divorce agreement was completely forgotten by Trevor after the phone call with Wynn.\nOn the day they returned to the country, Trevor packed the last document into his briefcase and ensured that nothing was left behind before heading downstairs.\n\"All set. Let's go.\"\nThe Lincoln stretch limousine departed from the villa and headed to the airport.\n\u2026\nThat night, at around 10:00 pm, the plane carrying Trevor and Jordyn landed on time. By the time they got home, it was nearly midnight. \nJordyn had fallen asleep before they arrived. When Trevor carried her upstairs, he passed the master bedroom and noticed the door was open, but the room was pitch black.\nAfter putting Jordyn on her bed and tucking her in, he returned to the master bedroom and turned on the light. Then, he glanced at the bed and found that it was empty\u2014Celeste wasn't there.\nJust then, the butler, Peter Hawk, came upstairs with his luggage. \nLoosening his tie, Trevor asked, \"Where is she?\"\nPeter replied, \"Mrs. Fleming is on a business trip.\"\nHalf a month ago, Peter hadn't been around when Celeste had left with her suitcase. The other maids told him that Celeste left with a suitcase, so he had assumed she was traveling for work.\nNow that he thought about it, this was unusual. Celeste rarely went on business trips. Even when she did, they typically lasted only two or three days.\nThis time, she had been gone for over two weeks.\n\"Alright,\" Trevor responded indifferently, asking no further questions.\n...\nThe next day, Celeste unexpectedly ran into Trevor at the company. She hadn't known that Trevor and Jordyn had returned to the country. Caught off guard by their sudden encounter, Celeste froze mid-step.\nTrevor also seemed slightly surprised to see her, but he assumed she had just returned from the business trip and didn't think much of it.\nHe passed by her coldly, his face expressionless. As usual, he treated her like she was a stranger and turned to enter the building.\nIn the past, if Celeste had found out that he'd suddenly come back, she would have been overjoyed. Even if she couldn't throw herself into his arms in such a scenario, she would have been very happy and excited. Her eyes would light up as she greeted him. \nEven if Trevor remained indifferent, she would have smiled and wished him good morning enthusiastically.\nBut now, Celeste merely glanced at his handsome face before lowering her eyes. There was no longer any trace of the joy and excitement she once felt.\nTrevor didn't notice any of this and was already walking away.\nWatching his tall and composed figure disappear into the building, Celeste wondered when he had returned. Since he was back, perhaps the matter of their divorce could soon be addressed.\nHaving resolved to go through with the divorce, Celeste didn't dwell on him further. After she returned to her workstation, she quickly immersed herself in her work.\nHalf an hour later, Zeke called her and instructed her to do something. \"Prepare two cups of coffee and take them to Mr. Fleming's office.\"\nIn the early days of her marriage, Celeste had learned that Trevor enjoyed coffee. In hopes of winning his favor, she had spent a great deal of effort studying how to brew it perfectly. Her efforts had paid off. After tasting her coffee, Trevor began to specifically request it, both at home and at the office.\nWhen she first realized he genuinely liked the coffee she made, Celeste had been thrilled. She naively believed it was the first step toward gaining his approval.\nBut she had underestimated his dislike and wariness of her. While he liked her coffee, that was all he liked. His attitude toward her remained cold and distant.\nEven when he wanted her coffee, he would have Zeke reach out to her. Once the coffee was prepared, someone else would pick it up for him. He never gave her the opportunity to approach him herself.\nOnly on rare occasions when no one else was available did she get the chance to deliver it to his office personally.\nThis time, it seemed she was to take the coffee directly to Trevor herself from Zeke's tone. After brewing the coffee, Celeste placed the cups on a tray and carried them to his office.\nThe door to his office was ajar.\nAs she approached and was about to knock on the door politely, she saw Wynn sitting on Trevor's lap. The two of them seemed to be locked in a passionate kiss.\nCeleste stopped in her tracks, her face turning pale.\nUpon seeing her, Wynn shot up from Trevor's lap, looking flustered.\nTrevor's expression darkened, and he questioned in an icy tone, \"Who allowed you to come in?\"\n..."

                  "text": "If your husband stayed cold around you, then his passion might have found someone else.\nCeleste looked into the restaurant - her husband wrapped his arms around his first love dotingly, while her daughter was giggling besides...she finally decided to let go.\nThe cheating husband, along with the daughter calling another woman \"mom\"\u2014she would throw them both out of her life!\n\nAfter seven years of marriage, my husband, Trevor, fell for another woman\u2014even our daughter wanted her as her new mom.\nI scoffed at the years I\u2019d wasted and handed him the divorce papers. Yet he dropped his usual aloofness, slamming me against the wall,\n\u201cDivorce? Not a chance.\u201d\n***\nWhen Celeste Rodriguez landed at the airport in Andostan, it was already past 9:00 pm.\nIt was her birthday. Her phone buzzed with messages from colleagues and friends\u2014but not a single one from her husband, Trevor Fleming.\nCeleste's smile faded.\nBy the time she reached the villa, it was already past 10:00 pm.\nHannah Lynd, the housekeeper looked startled. \"Mrs. Fleming... what a surprise.\"\n\"Where are Trevor and Jo?\" Celeste asked, handing over her luggage.\n\"Mr. Fleming isn\u2019t back yet. Miss Jordyn\u2019s upstairs playing.\"\nCeleste climbed the stairs. In her room, Jordyn sat in pajamas at her desk, completely absorbed.\n\"Jo?\" Celeste called.\nJordyn turned, her eyes lighting up. In a happy tone, she greeted, \"Mom!\"\nBut then she quickly got back to what she was doing earlier.\nCeleste walked over and hugged her tight, planting a kiss on her cheek. Yet the little one pushed her away and squirmed. \"Mom, I\u2019m busy.\" \nIt had been two months since Celeste last saw Jordyn. She missed her so much that no amount of kisses felt enough. She wanted to talk to Jordyn.\nShe noticed the necklace Jordyn was threading. \"Jo, are you making a seashell necklace?\"\n\"Mm-hm!\" Jordyn perked up visibly. \"Wynn's birthday is in a week. Dad and I picked and polished these ourselves. Pretty, right?\"\nCeleste\u2019s throat tightened. Jordyn didn\u2019t look up, only added brightly, \"Dad even got her a custom gift, tomorrow\u2014\"\nCeleste felt a pang in her chest and couldn't hold back anymore. \"Jo\u2026 Do you remember it's my birthday today?\"\n\"Huh?\" Jordyn glanced up briefly, then quickly looked back down at the string of beads in her hands, She complained, \"Mom, don\u2019t talk, Look, I messed up the bead order\u2014\"\nCeleste stood there in silence for a while, but Jordyn never looked back up. Finally, Celeste pursed her lips and left the room without another word.\nDownstairs, Hannah said, \"I called Mr. Fleming. He said he\u2019s busy tonight and you should rest first.\"\n\"I see.\" Celeste replied softly.\nShe hesitated, then called Trevor. It rang for a while before he answered.\nhis tone was indifferent as usual. \"I'm busy. Let's talk tomorrow\u2014\"\nA woman\u2019s voice chimed in: \"Trevor, who is it?\"\nWynn.\nCeleste gripped the phone tighter.\n\"No one important,\" Trevor answered her.\nBefore Celeste could say anything, Trevor had already hung up.\nCeleste stared at the screen. Two or three months apart, and this was all he had for her.\nAfter so many years of marriage, he\u2019d always been cold. Distant. Impatient. \nShe had got used to chasing after him, calling again, begging for time. Yet tonight, she didn\u2019t bother. \nPerhaps she was just too tired.\n\nThe next morning, Celeste thought it over and decided to call Trevor again.\nThere was a time difference of about 17 or 18 hours between Andostan and their home country. In Andostan, today was her actual birthday.\nShe didn\u2019t just come here for Jordyn. She wanted one thing: a family meal. Her only birthday wish.\nYet, Trevor didn\u2019t answer.\nA long time later, he texted: What\u2019s up?\nShe replied: Lunch today? Just the three of us.\nTrevor answered: Okay. Send the address.\nAlright, she typed back.\nThat was it. No acknowledgment. No \u201cHappy birthday.\u201d She wasn\u2019t surprised. But it still stung.\nAs she headed downstairs, she overheard Jordyn talking with Hannah.\n\"Aren't you happy that Mrs. Fleming is here, sweetie?\" Hannah asked.\n\"Dad and I promised to take Wynn to the beach tomorrow. If Mom comes, it'll be weird. She\u2019s always mean to Wynn.\"\n\"Mrs. Fleming is still your mom, sweetie. That\u2019s hurtful.\"\n\"I know, but Dad and I like Wynn more. Can't Wynn be my mom instead?\"\nCeleste froze.\nShe had raised Jordyn herself most of the time. But over the past two years, the more time Jordyn spent with Trevor, the more attached she became to him. When Trevor came to Andostan to expand his business last year, Jordyn had insisted on coming along.\nCeleste was reluctant and had hoped Jordyn would stay by her side. But she couldn't bear to see Jordyn upset, so she agreed.\nAnd now, Jordyn didn\u2019t even want her as her mom anymore.\nCeleste stood frozen in place, her face pale. To think that she had pushed aside her work to come to Andostan with the intention of spending more time with Jordyn.\nNow, it seemed unnecessary.\nShe walked back to her room, pale and quiet, then repacked the gifts she\u2019d brought.\nLater, Hannah texted: Madame, I took Jordyn out. Let me know if you need anything.\nCeleste sat on the bed, feeling hollow and lost inside. She had abandoned her work and made this trip, only to find no one wanted her here.\nHer arrival was nothing but a joke.\n\nAfter a long while, she left the villa. Aimlessly, she drove around in this foreign yet familiar country.\nBy noon, she remembered she had planned to have lunch with Trevor and Jordyn. As she recalled what she had overheard in the morning, she hesitated about whether to go home and pick up Jordyn. \nThen, a text from Trevor came: Something came up. Lunch\u2019s canceled.\nCeleste stared at it.\nShe should\u2019ve known. Trevor always canceled on her.  His work, friends, and everything else always came before her, his wife.\nOnce, she\u2019d cry. Today, she just felt\u2026 empty.\nCeleste was at an utter loss. She had come all this way excitedly only to be met with indifference from both Trevor and Jordyn.\nAimlessly, she drove around. Eventually, she found herself outside an old favorite restaurant which she and Trevor used to frequent.\nJust as she was about to walk in, she saw them.\nTrevor. Jordyn. Wynn.\nWynn sat next to Jordyn, laughing, feeding the little one the pastries she had taken a bite out of. Jordyn giggled, with her legs swinging around happily. Trevor smiled as he served food to both of them, but his gaze never left Wynn.\nWhat a happy family of three!\nSo this was his \"something came up.\"\nAnd this was the daughter she had carried for ten long months and nearly lost her life to bring into this world.\nCeleste laughed humorlessly. She stood there watching for a long time. Finally, she turned and drove away.\n\nBack at the villa, Celeste drafted the divorce agreement.\nTrevor had been her teenage dream\u2014but he had never truly seen her. If not for that one night and his grandfather Arnold Fleming\u2019s pressure, he never would\u2019ve married her. She thought loving him hard enough would be enough, but seven years proved otherwise.\nFor a long time, she felt lucky to have Jo\u2014her only source of comfort. But now, even Jo didn\u2019t seem to want her.\nThat was it.\nShe was done\u2014with the marriage, the lies, the thankless role of wife and mother. It was time to leave all this behind\u2014and reclaim the promising life she'd given up!\nShe sealed the divorce papers, handed them to Hannah, then grabbed her suitcase and walked out, bound for the airport. On the way, she finally dialed the number she\u2019d been avoiding for months.\nThe line rang once. Twice. A click.\n\u201cHello?\u201d\nShe took a breath, steady and sharp.\u201cThat offer still stand?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d\n...\nAt around 9:00 pm, Trevor and Jordyn returned home.\nJordyn clung to the hem of Trevor's coat and got out of the car sluggishly. Because Celeste was at home, she was reluctant to return that night.\nBut Wynn had said that Celeste came specifically to be with her and Trevor, and if they didn't return, she would be sad. Trevor also said that if they didn't go home that night, Celeste would definitely insist on joining them on their outing to the sea the next day.\nReluctantly, Jordyn agreed to come home.\nStill worried, she muttered gloomily, \"Dad, what if Mom insists on tagging along with us tomorrow?\"\n\"She won't,\" Trevor replied confidently.\nIn all the years they'd been married, Celeste had always tried to find ways to spend more time with him. But she was also sensible. As long as he made his stance clear, she wouldn't dare make him upset.\nIn Jordyn's memory, Celeste always listened to Trevor. Since he said she wouldn't, she felt reassured. As a result, her mood lifted. She made her way into the villa cheerfully and told Hannah she wanted to take a bath.\n\"Sure, sure,\" Hannah replied to Jordyn. Then, she remembered Celeste's instructions and handed an envelope to Trevor. \"Mr. Fleming, this is from Mrs. Fleming. She asked me to give it to you.\"\nTrevor took the envelope and asked casually, \"Where is she?\"\n\"Mrs. Fleming packed up and went back to the country this afternoon. Didn't you know?\" Hannah responded.\nTrevor paused mid-step as he was heading upstairs. He turned back, feeling a little surprised. \"Has she gone back?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nWhy had Celeste suddenly come to Andostan? Trevor hadn't given her a chance to tell him about it. He hadn't cared to ask either. Upon learning she'd left, he didn't dwell on it.\nJordyn was a little surprised too. When she heard the news, she felt a small twinge of disappointment. She'd been thinking that even if Celeste didn't join them for the outing tomorrow, it might be nice to have her around at home in the evening.\nPolishing the seashells made her hands hurt\u2014she had been counting on Celeste's help in finishing the necklace.\nThough it had been months since Trevor and Celeste had seen each other, she had made the effort to visit but only to leave without seeing him in person. Hannah recalled Celeste's grim expression as she left and thought that things felt a little off.\nShe couldn't help but say, \"Mr. Fleming, Mrs. Fleming looked upset when she left. She seemed angry.\"\nHannah had assumed Celeste's sudden departure was due to an urgent matter. Upon realizing Trevor hadn't known she'd left, she began to feel something was amiss.\n\"Angry?\" Trevor repeated in his mind. \nIn his presence, Celeste had always been patient and accommodating. So, she could get angry too? This was new.\nTrevor smiled faintly and responded to Hannah perfunctorily before heading upstairs.\nBack in the bedroom, he was about to open the envelope Celeste had left when Wynn called. After answering the call, he tossed the envelope aside and walked out the door.\nA short while later, the envelope slipped off the bed onto the floor.\nThat night, Trevor didn't return home.\nThe next day, Hannah noticed the envelope on the floor when she was cleaning. Recognizing it as the one Celeste had asked her to hand over, she assumed Trevor had already seen it and placed it in a nearby drawer.\n\u2026\nRight after getting off the plane, Celeste went home and began packing her belongings. She had accumulated quite a few things in the house since she'd been living there for six years, after all. But she only took a few sets of clothes, two sets of daily necessities, and some books that were related to her field of study back in college.\nAfter their marriage, Trevor had been depositing money for her and Jordyn into two separate accounts every month. One account was hers, and the other was Jordyn's.\nHowever, Celeste was used to spending her own money only. She had never touched the money in Jordyn's account. Because she loved Trevor, whenever she went shopping and saw clothes, shoes, cufflinks, or ties that suited him, she couldn't help but buy them.\nIn contrast, she didn't have many expenses on a daily basis because all she did was go to work. Her heart and mind were always focused on Trevor and Jordyn. She wanted to give them the best of everything.\nMost of the money Trevor deposited into her bank account was spent on him and Jordyn.\nGiven this spending pattern, there shouldn't have been much money left in Celeste's account. But over the past year, her opportunities to buy things for Trevor and Jordyn had decreased significantly because they were in Andostan.\nNow, there were over three million dollars in her account. That amount might not matter to Trevor, but to her, it was no small sum. And since it was her money, Celeste didn't hesitate to transfer it out.\nShe left both cards behind, dragged her suitcase out the door, and didn't look back.\nCeleste had an apartment near her workplace, which was a little over 1,100 square feet. She'd bought it four years ago to support a friend who had been struggling to meet their sales targets. She had never lived there before.\nNow, the apartment came in handy. She had it cleaned regularly, so it wasn't dirty. After a quick tidy-up, it was ready to move in.\nAfter a long day, Celeste washed up and went to bed around 10:00 pm.\n\u2026\nThe shrill sound of an alarm jolted Celeste awake. Startled, her mind went blank for a moment.\nWhen she came to her senses, she realized that while it was 1:00 am here, it was 7:00 am in Andostan, where Trevor and Jordyn were. This was their usual breakfast time.\nEver since Jordyn had gone to live with Trevor in Andostan, Celeste had developed the habit of calling her at this time every day. As she was always exhausted from work and was used to going to bed early, she had set this alarm to ensure she wouldn't miss the call.\nAt first, Jordyn hadn't adapted well to living in Andostan and had missed her terribly. She had called Celeste constantly. But as time went on, the calls that used to be full of yearning and dependence had grown perfunctory and impatient.\nThe alarm was no longer necessary. She just hadn't been able to let go.\nSmiling bitterly, Celeste deleted the alarm and turned off her phone before going back to sleep.\n\u2026\nMeanwhile, Trevor and Jordyn were nearly done with breakfast. Though he knew Celeste usually called Jordyn at this time, he wasn't always home and hadn't paid much attention to the routine.\nHe noticed that Celeste hadn't called that day. The fact registered in his mind, but he didn't care. After finishing breakfast, he went upstairs to change.\nJordyn, finding Celeste increasingly annoying, had grown less fond of their calls. Upon realizing that Celeste hadn't called yet, she figured something must have come up.\nShe grabbed her backpack and bolted for the door.\nHannah hurried after her. \"Ms. Fleming, it's still early. There's no rush!\"\nJordyn ignored her and ran to the car happily. She was thrilled that Celeste hadn't called on time that day. If she stayed home, she might still have to talk to Celeste later. Well, she didn't want that!\n\u2026\nAfter getting married to Trevor, Celeste had joined Fleming Group for his sake. Now that she was planning to divorce him, she saw no reason to stay.\nThe next morning, Celeste handed her resignation letter to Zeke Jackson after arriving at the office.\nZeke was one of Trevor's personal secretaries. When he saw Celeste's resignation letter, he was extremely surprised.\nHe was one of the few in the company who knew about the relationship between Celeste and Trevor.\nAnyone familiar with Trevor knew that he didn't love Celeste. So, he had been cold to her and rarely went home after their marriage.\nTo get closer to and win over Trevor, Celeste had chosen to work at Fleming Group.\nHer initial goal was to become his personal secretary, but Trevor refused vehemently. Even when Arnold stepped in, he couldn't get Trevor to agree. In the end, Celeste had to settle for a position in the secretarial team, becoming one of Trevor's many ordinary secretaries.\nAt first, Zeke had worried that Celeste's presence in the secretarial team would create chaos. But to his surprise, she didn't bring them any trouble. Although Celeste used her position to get closer to Trevor, she was mindful of her timing and never overstepped her boundaries. \nOn the contrary, she worked diligently and performed exceptionally well, hoping to gain Trevor's respect. Whether during her pregnancy, childbirth, or any other time, she strictly adhered to company policies and never sought special treatment.\nOver the years, Celeste rose to become the head of the secretarial team. Zeke had observed her feelings for Trevor from the sidelines all the while. To be honest, he had never imagined she would resign one day. He felt skeptical about her willingly giving up her position.\nSomething must have happened between Celeste and Trevor for her to resign now. Zeke understood that this was something he wasn't privy to\u2014it must be something significant enough for Trevor to have ordered her to resign.\nWhile he found it a pity, Zeke maintained a professional tone. \"I acknowledge that I've received your resignation letter. I'll arrange for someone to take over your duties as soon as possible.\"\n\"Alright.\" Celeste nodded and returned to her workstation.\nAfter working for a while, Zeke started an online meeting with Trevor to report on company matters. As the conversation neared its end, he suddenly remembered Celeste's resignation. \n\"Oh, Mr. Fleming, there's one more thing\u2014\"\nAlthough Zeke had told Celeste he would quickly arrange for someone to take over her position, he wanted to gauge Trevor's thoughts on the matter first. If Trevor wanted Celeste out immediately, he would make the arrangements right away.\nBut as the words left his mouth, he remembered that when Celeste first joined the company, Trevor had explicitly stated that all matters regarding her employment should be handled per company regulations. He made it clear that there was no need to report anything to him since he wouldn't concern himself with her.\nAnd indeed, over the years, Trevor had never actively inquired about Celeste's work at the company.\nEven when he encountered her at work, he treated her like she was a complete stranger.\nWhen Celeste was set to be promoted a couple of years ago, the team had hesitated. Everyone was aware of Trevor's dislike for her. They had even brought it up with him to gauge his opinion back then.\nTrevor had frowned in annoyance and reiterated that he wouldn't interfere and that they should handle it according to company policy. He had emphasized that they shouldn't bring up Celeste's matters with him again.\nSeeing Zeke's hesitation, Trevor frowned. \"What is it?\"\nZeke snapped out of his thoughts and quickly replied, \"Oh, it's nothing.\"\nSince Trevor was already aware of Celeste's resignation but hadn't brought it up, it was clear that this matter wasn't important to him. So, Zeke decided to proceed as usual and handle the matter according to company regulations.\nWith that resolved, Trevor ended the call.\n\u2026\n\"What are you thinking about?\" At noon, a colleague patted Celeste on the shoulder.\nCeleste came back to her senses and smiled, shaking her head. \"Nothing.\"\n\"Don't you need to call your daughter today?\"\n\"No, not today.\"\nTypically, she called Jordyn twice a day\u2014once at 1:00 am and once at around 12:00 pm.\nHer colleagues at work were aware of this habit. What they didn't know was her daughter was the child she had with the company's CEO.\nAfter work, Celeste went to the supermarket. She bought some groceries and a few potted plants before heading home.\nAfter dinner, she browsed online for information about the upcoming technology exhibition. \nAfter that, she made a call. \"Please reserve a ticket for next month's tech exhibition for me.\"\n\"Are you sure?\" the person on the other end replied coolly. \"The last two times you asked me to reserve tickets, you didn't show up. Do you know how many people's lifelong dream is to get one of those tickets? You wasted them thoughtlessly.\"\nThe annual tech exhibition was a major event in the industry, and tickets were not easily obtainable.\nTheir company had a limited number of slots, and many IT elites working for them eagerly vied for the opportunity to attend it.\n\"If I don't show up to the exhibition this time, I will never ask you to reserve a ticket for me ever again,\" Celeste promised.\nThere was silence on the other end before the line disconnected. \nCeleste knew that he'd agreed. The corners of her mouth tugged upward into a smile. What she hadn't said was that she wanted to return to the company.\nThough she was one of the partners of her tech firm, she had stepped back during its early days to focus on marriage and family. Her decision had disrupted their development plans and cost them many opportunities.\nHer colleagues had been both angry and frustrated with her. Over the years, they had rarely been in contact.\nWhile Celeste was eager to return, she knew she had been out of the industry for too long. If she went back unprepared, she was worried she wouldn't be able to keep up with the company's current pace.\nSo, she planned to spend some time familiarizing herself with the industry's latest developments before making a concrete decision.\nFor the next few days, Celeste focused on her work during office hours and spent her evenings tending to her own matters. She didn't reach out to Jordyn or Trevor, and they didn't contact her either.\nCeleste wasn't surprised. For over half a year, her communication with them had been one-sided. They had only passively responded to her efforts.\n\u2026\nMeanwhile, in Andostan, Jordyn had developed the habit of calling Wynn first thing every morning.\nThat day, she called Wynn right after waking up as usual. However, the call didn't last long before she burst into tears.\nWynn had told her some bad news. \"I'm going back to the country soon.\"\nDevastated, Jordyn finished the call and immediately phoned Trevor. \"Dad, did you know about this?\"\nAt his office, Trevor flipped through some documents. \"Yes.\"\n\"When did you find out?\"\n\"It's been a while.\"\n\"Dad, you're so mean\u2026\" Jordyn hugged her pink stuffed pig and cried loudly. \"I don't want Wynn to leave. If she's not here, I don't want to go to school here anymore. I want to go back too!\"\nTrevor's tone remained even. \"It's already being arranged.\"\nJordyn didn't understand. \"W-What do you mean?\"\n\"We're going back next week.\"\nJordyn jumped out of bed in excitement. \"Really?\"\n\"Yes, really,\" Trevor replied.\n\"Then why didn't Wynn tell me just now?\"\n\"It was just finalized. She doesn't know yet.\"\nJordyn was ecstatic. \"Dad, let's keep this a secret from Wynn. We'll surprise her when we go back to the country, okay?\"\n\"Alright.\"\n\"You're the best, Dad! I love you so much!\"\nAfter hanging up, Jordyn was still overjoyed. She sang and danced on her bed.\nAfter a while, she suddenly thought of Celeste. For the past few days, she had been in a great mood because Celeste hadn't called her. In fact, to avoid talking to Celeste, she had deliberately left home early and even turned off her phone or kept it far away from her after school.\nBut after two days, she was worried that Celeste might get angry if she found out. So, she stopped doing that. To her surprise, Celeste hadn't called at all in the days that followed.\nAt first, she thought Celeste had discovered that she was deliberately avoiding her calls. But then she remembered that based on past experiences, that wasn't very likely. If Celeste knew she had done something wrong, she would immediately ask Jordyn to correct her wrongdoing instead of sulking and not calling.\nAfter all, she was the most important person to Celeste. Jordyn knew that Celeste loved her the most, so she didn't think that Celeste would purposely refrain from calling her simply because she was upset.\nAs Jordyn thought about this, she suddenly missed Celeste. It was the first time in days she had thought about Celeste, and she couldn't resist dialing Celeste's number.\nBut just as the call connected, she remembered that while she would get to see Wynn after returning to the country, Celeste would undoubtedly try every possible way to prevent her from meeting Wynn. She wouldn't be able to see Wynn whenever she wanted like she could now.\nThis thought dampened Jordyn's mood.\nIt was midnight in Celeste's time zone. She was already asleep when she was woken by the call. Upon seeing Jordyn's name on the screen, she was about to answer when the call abruptly disconnected.\nAlthough Celeste had written in her divorce agreement that she would relinquish custody of Jordyn, she still felt a sense of responsibility as her mother. Worried that something might have happened, Celeste immediately called back.\nWhen Jordyn saw the incoming call, she turned her head away and refused to answer.\nCeleste became more concerned and quickly called the landline at the villa.\nHannah answered promptly. After hearing Celeste's concerns, she reassured her, \"Ms. Fleming should be fine. She went to bed late last night and woke up late today. When I checked earlier, she was still asleep. I'll go upstairs to take a look and call you back.\"\nFeeling relieved, Celeste replied, \"Thank you.\"\nWhen Hannah went upstairs, Jordyn was already in the bathroom brushing her teeth.\nAfter Hannah relayed Celeste being worried about her, Jordyn lowered her head and lied, \"I accidentally hit the call button.\"\nHannah believed her and didn't doubt what she said. Seeing that Jordyn was still brushing her teeth, she went back downstairs to update Celeste that Jordyn was fine.\nJordyn watched as Hannah left. She huffed and finally felt a bit better.\nAfter hearing Hannah's reassurance, Celeste felt relieved too. Still, having been abruptly woken, she struggled to fall back asleep. She wasn't in great shape the next morning at work.\nThe envelope containing the divorce agreement was completely forgotten by Trevor after the phone call with Wynn.\nOn the day they returned to the country, Trevor packed the last document into his briefcase and ensured that nothing was left behind before heading downstairs.\n\"All set. Let's go.\"\nThe Lincoln stretch limousine departed from the villa and headed to the airport.\n\u2026\nThat night, at around 10:00 pm, the plane carrying Trevor and Jordyn landed on time. By the time they got home, it was nearly midnight. \nJordyn had fallen asleep before they arrived. When Trevor carried her upstairs, he passed the master bedroom and noticed the door was open, but the room was pitch black.\nAfter putting Jordyn on her bed and tucking her in, he returned to the master bedroom and turned on the light. Then, he glanced at the bed and found that it was empty\u2014Celeste wasn't there.\nJust then, the butler, Peter Hawk, came upstairs with his luggage. \nLoosening his tie, Trevor asked, \"Where is she?\"\nPeter replied, \"Mrs. Fleming is on a business trip.\"\nHalf a month ago, Peter hadn't been around when Celeste had left with her suitcase. The other maids told him that Celeste left with a suitcase, so he had assumed she was traveling for work.\nNow that he thought about it, this was unusual. Celeste rarely went on business trips. Even when she did, they typically lasted only two or three days.\nThis time, she had been gone for over two weeks.\n\"Alright,\" Trevor responded indifferently, asking no further questions.\n...\nThe next day, Celeste unexpectedly ran into Trevor at the company. She hadn't known that Trevor and Jordyn had returned to the country. Caught off guard by their sudden encounter, Celeste froze mid-step.\nTrevor also seemed slightly surprised to see her, but he assumed she had just returned from the business trip and didn't think much of it.\nHe passed by her coldly, his face expressionless. As usual, he treated her like she was a stranger and turned to enter the building.\nIn the past, if Celeste had found out that he'd suddenly come back, she would have been overjoyed. Even if she couldn't throw herself into his arms in such a scenario, she would have been very happy and excited. Her eyes would light up as she greeted him. \nEven if Trevor remained indifferent, she would have smiled and wished him good morning enthusiastically.\nBut now, Celeste merely glanced at his handsome face before lowering her eyes. There was no longer any trace of the joy and excitement she once felt.\nTrevor didn't notice any of this and was already walking away.\nWatching his tall and composed figure disappear into the building, Celeste wondered when he had returned. Since he was back, perhaps the matter of their divorce could soon be addressed.\nHaving resolved to go through with the divorce, Celeste didn't dwell on him further. After she returned to her workstation, she quickly immersed herself in her work.\nHalf an hour later, Zeke called her and instructed her to do something. \"Prepare two cups of coffee and take them to Mr. Fleming's office.\"\nIn the early days of her marriage, Celeste had learned that Trevor enjoyed coffee. In hopes of winning his favor, she had spent a great deal of effort studying how to brew it perfectly. Her efforts had paid off. After tasting her coffee, Trevor began to specifically request it, both at home and at the office.\nWhen she first realized he genuinely liked the coffee she made, Celeste had been thrilled. She naively believed it was the first step toward gaining his approval.\nBut she had underestimated his dislike and wariness of her. While he liked her coffee, that was all he liked. His attitude toward her remained cold and distant.\nEven when he wanted her coffee, he would have Zeke reach out to her. Once the coffee was prepared, someone else would pick it up for him. He never gave her the opportunity to approach him herself.\nOnly on rare occasions when no one else was available did she get the chance to deliver it to his office personally.\nThis time, it seemed she was to take the coffee directly to Trevor herself from Zeke's tone. After brewing the coffee, Celeste placed the cups on a tray and carried them to his office.\nThe door to his office was ajar.\nAs she approached and was about to knock on the door politely, she saw Wynn sitting on Trevor's lap. The two of them seemed to be locked in a passionate kiss.\nCeleste stopped in her tracks, her face turning pale.\nUpon seeing her, Wynn shot up from Trevor's lap, looking flustered.\nTrevor's expression darkened, and he questioned in an icy tone, \"Who allowed you to come in?\"\n..."

                  "text": "If your husband stayed cold around you, then his passion might have found someone else.\nCeleste looked into the restaurant - her husband wrapped his arms around his first love dotingly, while her daughter was giggling besides...she finally decided to let go.\nThe cheating husband, along with the daughter calling another woman \"mom\"\u2014she would throw them both out of her life!\n\nAfter seven years of marriage, my husband, Trevor, fell for another woman\u2014even our daughter wanted her as her new mom.\nI scoffed at the years I\u2019d wasted and handed him the divorce papers. Yet he dropped his usual aloofness, slamming me against the wall,\n\u201cDivorce? Not a chance.\u201d\n***\nWhen Celeste Rodriguez landed at the airport in Andostan, it was already past 9:00 pm.\nIt was her birthday. Her phone buzzed with messages from colleagues and friends\u2014but not a single one from her husband, Trevor Fleming.\nCeleste's smile faded.\nBy the time she reached the villa, it was already past 10:00 pm.\nHannah Lynd, the housekeeper looked startled. \"Mrs. Fleming... what a surprise.\"\n\"Where are Trevor and Jo?\" Celeste asked, handing over her luggage.\n\"Mr. Fleming isn\u2019t back yet. Miss Jordyn\u2019s upstairs playing.\"\nCeleste climbed the stairs. In her room, Jordyn sat in pajamas at her desk, completely absorbed.\n\"Jo?\" Celeste called.\nJordyn turned, her eyes lighting up. In a happy tone, she greeted, \"Mom!\"\nBut then she quickly got back to what she was doing earlier.\nCeleste walked over and hugged her tight, planting a kiss on her cheek. Yet the little one pushed her away and squirmed. \"Mom, I\u2019m busy.\" \nIt had been two months since Celeste last saw Jordyn. She missed her so much that no amount of kisses felt enough. She wanted to talk to Jordyn.\nShe noticed the necklace Jordyn was threading. \"Jo, are you making a seashell necklace?\"\n\"Mm-hm!\" Jordyn perked up visibly. \"Wynn's birthday is in a week. Dad and I picked and polished these ourselves. Pretty, right?\"\nCeleste\u2019s throat tightened. Jordyn didn\u2019t look up, only added brightly, \"Dad even got her a custom gift, tomorrow\u2014\"\nCeleste felt a pang in her chest and couldn't hold back anymore. \"Jo\u2026 Do you remember it's my birthday today?\"\n\"Huh?\" Jordyn glanced up briefly, then quickly looked back down at the string of beads in her hands, She complained, \"Mom, don\u2019t talk, Look, I messed up the bead order\u2014\"\nCeleste stood there in silence for a while, but Jordyn never looked back up. Finally, Celeste pursed her lips and left the room without another word.\nDownstairs, Hannah said, \"I called Mr. Fleming. He said he\u2019s busy tonight and you should rest first.\"\n\"I see.\" Celeste replied softly.\nShe hesitated, then called Trevor. It rang for a while before he answered.\nhis tone was indifferent as usual. \"I'm busy. Let's talk tomorrow\u2014\"\nA woman\u2019s voice chimed in: \"Trevor, who is it?\"\nWynn.\nCeleste gripped the phone tighter.\n\"No one important,\" Trevor answered her.\nBefore Celeste could say anything, Trevor had already hung up.\nCeleste stared at the screen. Two or three months apart, and this was all he had for her.\nAfter so many years of marriage, he\u2019d always been cold. Distant. Impatient. \nShe had got used to chasing after him, calling again, begging for time. Yet tonight, she didn\u2019t bother. \nPerhaps she was just too tired.\n\nThe next morning, Celeste thought it over and decided to call Trevor again.\nThere was a time difference of about 17 or 18 hours between Andostan and their home country. In Andostan, today was her actual birthday.\nShe didn\u2019t just come here for Jordyn. She wanted one thing: a family meal. Her only birthday wish.\nYet, Trevor didn\u2019t answer.\nA long time later, he texted: What\u2019s up?\nShe replied: Lunch today? Just the three of us.\nTrevor answered: Okay. Send the address.\nAlright, she typed back.\nThat was it. No acknowledgment. No \u201cHappy birthday.\u201d She wasn\u2019t surprised. But it still stung.\nAs she headed downstairs, she overheard Jordyn talking with Hannah.\n\"Aren't you happy that Mrs. Fleming is here, sweetie?\" Hannah asked.\n\"Dad and I promised to take Wynn to the beach tomorrow. If Mom comes, it'll be weird. She\u2019s always mean to Wynn.\"\n\"Mrs. Fleming is still your mom, sweetie. That\u2019s hurtful.\"\n\"I know, but Dad and I like Wynn more. Can't Wynn be my mom instead?\"\nCeleste froze.\nShe had raised Jordyn herself most of the time. But over the past two years, the more time Jordyn spent with Trevor, the more attached she became to him. When Trevor came to Andostan to expand his business last year, Jordyn had insisted on coming along.\nCeleste was reluctant and had hoped Jordyn would stay by her side. But she couldn't bear to see Jordyn upset, so she agreed.\nAnd now, Jordyn didn\u2019t even want her as her mom anymore.\nCeleste stood frozen in place, her face pale. To think that she had pushed aside her work to come to Andostan with the intention of spending more time with Jordyn.\nNow, it seemed unnecessary.\nShe walked back to her room, pale and quiet, then repacked the gifts she\u2019d brought.\nLater, Hannah texted: Madame, I took Jordyn out. Let me know if you need anything.\nCeleste sat on the bed, feeling hollow and lost inside. She had abandoned her work and made this trip, only to find no one wanted her here.\nHer arrival was nothing but a joke.\n\nAfter a long while, she left the villa. Aimlessly, she drove around in this foreign yet familiar country.\nBy noon, she remembered she had planned to have lunch with Trevor and Jordyn. As she recalled what she had overheard in the morning, she hesitated about whether to go home and pick up Jordyn. \nThen, a text from Trevor came: Something came up. Lunch\u2019s canceled.\nCeleste stared at it.\nShe should\u2019ve known. Trevor always canceled on her.  His work, friends, and everything else always came before her, his wife.\nOnce, she\u2019d cry. Today, she just felt\u2026 empty.\nCeleste was at an utter loss. She had come all this way excitedly only to be met with indifference from both Trevor and Jordyn.\nAimlessly, she drove around. Eventually, she found herself outside an old favorite restaurant which she and Trevor used to frequent.\nJust as she was about to walk in, she saw them.\nTrevor. Jordyn. Wynn.\nWynn sat next to Jordyn, laughing, feeding the little one the pastries she had taken a bite out of. Jordyn giggled, with her legs swinging around happily. Trevor smiled as he served food to both of them, but his gaze never left Wynn.\nWhat a happy family of three!\nSo this was his \"something came up.\"\nAnd this was the daughter she had carried for ten long months and nearly lost her life to bring into this world.\nCeleste laughed humorlessly. She stood there watching for a long time. Finally, she turned and drove away.\n\nBack at the villa, Celeste drafted the divorce agreement.\nTrevor had been her teenage dream\u2014but he had never truly seen her. If not for that one night and his grandfather Arnold Fleming\u2019s pressure, he never would\u2019ve married her. She thought loving him hard enough would be enough, but seven years proved otherwise.\nFor a long time, she felt lucky to have Jo\u2014her only source of comfort. But now, even Jo didn\u2019t seem to want her.\nThat was it.\nShe was done\u2014with the marriage, the lies, the thankless role of wife and mother. It was time to leave all this behind\u2014and reclaim the promising life she'd given up!\nShe sealed the divorce papers, handed them to Hannah, then grabbed her suitcase and walked out, bound for the airport. On the way, she finally dialed the number she\u2019d been avoiding for months.\nThe line rang once. Twice. A click.\n\u201cHello?\u201d\nShe took a breath, steady and sharp.\u201cThat offer still stand?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d\n...\nAt around 9:00 pm, Trevor and Jordyn returned home.\nJordyn clung to the hem of Trevor's coat and got out of the car sluggishly. Because Celeste was at home, she was reluctant to return that night.\nBut Wynn had said that Celeste came specifically to be with her and Trevor, and if they didn't return, she would be sad. Trevor also said that if they didn't go home that night, Celeste would definitely insist on joining them on their outing to the sea the next day.\nReluctantly, Jordyn agreed to come home.\nStill worried, she muttered gloomily, \"Dad, what if Mom insists on tagging along with us tomorrow?\"\n\"She won't,\" Trevor replied confidently.\nIn all the years they'd been married, Celeste had always tried to find ways to spend more time with him. But she was also sensible. As long as he made his stance clear, she wouldn't dare make him upset.\nIn Jordyn's memory, Celeste always listened to Trevor. Since he said she wouldn't, she felt reassured. As a result, her mood lifted. She made her way into the villa cheerfully and told Hannah she wanted to take a bath.\n\"Sure, sure,\" Hannah replied to Jordyn. Then, she remembered Celeste's instructions and handed an envelope to Trevor. \"Mr. Fleming, this is from Mrs. Fleming. She asked me to give it to you.\"\nTrevor took the envelope and asked casually, \"Where is she?\"\n\"Mrs. Fleming packed up and went back to the country this afternoon. Didn't you know?\" Hannah responded.\nTrevor paused mid-step as he was heading upstairs. He turned back, feeling a little surprised. \"Has she gone back?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nWhy had Celeste suddenly come to Andostan? Trevor hadn't given her a chance to tell him about it. He hadn't cared to ask either. Upon learning she'd left, he didn't dwell on it.\nJordyn was a little surprised too. When she heard the news, she felt a small twinge of disappointment. She'd been thinking that even if Celeste didn't join them for the outing tomorrow, it might be nice to have her around at home in the evening.\nPolishing the seashells made her hands hurt\u2014she had been counting on Celeste's help in finishing the necklace.\nThough it had been months since Trevor and Celeste had seen each other, she had made the effort to visit but only to leave without seeing him in person. Hannah recalled Celeste's grim expression as she left and thought that things felt a little off.\nShe couldn't help but say, \"Mr. Fleming, Mrs. Fleming looked upset when she left. She seemed angry.\"\nHannah had assumed Celeste's sudden departure was due to an urgent matter. Upon realizing Trevor hadn't known she'd left, she began to feel something was amiss.\n\"Angry?\" Trevor repeated in his mind. \nIn his presence, Celeste had always been patient and accommodating. So, she could get angry too? This was new.\nTrevor smiled faintly and responded to Hannah perfunctorily before heading upstairs.\nBack in the bedroom, he was about to open the envelope Celeste had left when Wynn called. After answering the call, he tossed the envelope aside and walked out the door.\nA short while later, the envelope slipped off the bed onto the floor.\nThat night, Trevor didn't return home.\nThe next day, Hannah noticed the envelope on the floor when she was cleaning. Recognizing it as the one Celeste had asked her to hand over, she assumed Trevor had already seen it and placed it in a nearby drawer.\n\u2026\nRight after getting off the plane, Celeste went home and began packing her belongings. She had accumulated quite a few things in the house since she'd been living there for six years, after all. But she only took a few sets of clothes, two sets of daily necessities, and some books that were related to her field of study back in college.\nAfter their marriage, Trevor had been depositing money for her and Jordyn into two separate accounts every month. One account was hers, and the other was Jordyn's.\nHowever, Celeste was used to spending her own money only. She had never touched the money in Jordyn's account. Because she loved Trevor, whenever she went shopping and saw clothes, shoes, cufflinks, or ties that suited him, she couldn't help but buy them.\nIn contrast, she didn't have many expenses on a daily basis because all she did was go to work. Her heart and mind were always focused on Trevor and Jordyn. She wanted to give them the best of everything.\nMost of the money Trevor deposited into her bank account was spent on him and Jordyn.\nGiven this spending pattern, there shouldn't have been much money left in Celeste's account. But over the past year, her opportunities to buy things for Trevor and Jordyn had decreased significantly because they were in Andostan.\nNow, there were over three million dollars in her account. That amount might not matter to Trevor, but to her, it was no small sum. And since it was her money, Celeste didn't hesitate to transfer it out.\nShe left both cards behind, dragged her suitcase out the door, and didn't look back.\nCeleste had an apartment near her workplace, which was a little over 1,100 square feet. She'd bought it four years ago to support a friend who had been struggling to meet their sales targets. She had never lived there before.\nNow, the apartment came in handy. She had it cleaned regularly, so it wasn't dirty. After a quick tidy-up, it was ready to move in.\nAfter a long day, Celeste washed up and went to bed around 10:00 pm.\n\u2026\nThe shrill sound of an alarm jolted Celeste awake. Startled, her mind went blank for a moment.\nWhen she came to her senses, she realized that while it was 1:00 am here, it was 7:00 am in Andostan, where Trevor and Jordyn were. This was their usual breakfast time.\nEver since Jordyn had gone to live with Trevor in Andostan, Celeste had developed the habit of calling her at this time every day. As she was always exhausted from work and was used to going to bed early, she had set this alarm to ensure she wouldn't miss the call.\nAt first, Jordyn hadn't adapted well to living in Andostan and had missed her terribly. She had called Celeste constantly. But as time went on, the calls that used to be full of yearning and dependence had grown perfunctory and impatient.\nThe alarm was no longer necessary. She just hadn't been able to let go.\nSmiling bitterly, Celeste deleted the alarm and turned off her phone before going back to sleep.\n\u2026\nMeanwhile, Trevor and Jordyn were nearly done with breakfast. Though he knew Celeste usually called Jordyn at this time, he wasn't always home and hadn't paid much attention to the routine.\nHe noticed that Celeste hadn't called that day. The fact registered in his mind, but he didn't care. After finishing breakfast, he went upstairs to change.\nJordyn, finding Celeste increasingly annoying, had grown less fond of their calls. Upon realizing that Celeste hadn't called yet, she figured something must have come up.\nShe grabbed her backpack and bolted for the door.\nHannah hurried after her. \"Ms. Fleming, it's still early. There's no rush!\"\nJordyn ignored her and ran to the car happily. She was thrilled that Celeste hadn't called on time that day. If she stayed home, she might still have to talk to Celeste later. Well, she didn't want that!\n\u2026\nAfter getting married to Trevor, Celeste had joined Fleming Group for his sake. Now that she was planning to divorce him, she saw no reason to stay.\nThe next morning, Celeste handed her resignation letter to Zeke Jackson after arriving at the office.\nZeke was one of Trevor's personal secretaries. When he saw Celeste's resignation letter, he was extremely surprised.\nHe was one of the few in the company who knew about the relationship between Celeste and Trevor.\nAnyone familiar with Trevor knew that he didn't love Celeste. So, he had been cold to her and rarely went home after their marriage.\nTo get closer to and win over Trevor, Celeste had chosen to work at Fleming Group.\nHer initial goal was to become his personal secretary, but Trevor refused vehemently. Even when Arnold stepped in, he couldn't get Trevor to agree. In the end, Celeste had to settle for a position in the secretarial team, becoming one of Trevor's many ordinary secretaries.\nAt first, Zeke had worried that Celeste's presence in the secretarial team would create chaos. But to his surprise, she didn't bring them any trouble. Although Celeste used her position to get closer to Trevor, she was mindful of her timing and never overstepped her boundaries. \nOn the contrary, she worked diligently and performed exceptionally well, hoping to gain Trevor's respect. Whether during her pregnancy, childbirth, or any other time, she strictly adhered to company policies and never sought special treatment.\nOver the years, Celeste rose to become the head of the secretarial team. Zeke had observed her feelings for Trevor from the sidelines all the while. To be honest, he had never imagined she would resign one day. He felt skeptical about her willingly giving up her position.\nSomething must have happened between Celeste and Trevor for her to resign now. Zeke understood that this was something he wasn't privy to\u2014it must be something significant enough for Trevor to have ordered her to resign.\nWhile he found it a pity, Zeke maintained a professional tone. \"I acknowledge that I've received your resignation letter. I'll arrange for someone to take over your duties as soon as possible.\"\n\"Alright.\" Celeste nodded and returned to her workstation.\nAfter working for a while, Zeke started an online meeting with Trevor to report on company matters. As the conversation neared its end, he suddenly remembered Celeste's resignation. \n\"Oh, Mr. Fleming, there's one more thing\u2014\"\nAlthough Zeke had told Celeste he would quickly arrange for someone to take over her position, he wanted to gauge Trevor's thoughts on the matter first. If Trevor wanted Celeste out immediately, he would make the arrangements right away.\nBut as the words left his mouth, he remembered that when Celeste first joined the company, Trevor had explicitly stated that all matters regarding her employment should be handled per company regulations. He made it clear that there was no need to report anything to him since he wouldn't concern himself with her.\nAnd indeed, over the years, Trevor had never actively inquired about Celeste's work at the company.\nEven when he encountered her at work, he treated her like she was a complete stranger.\nWhen Celeste was set to be promoted a couple of years ago, the team had hesitated. Everyone was aware of Trevor's dislike for her. They had even brought it up with him to gauge his opinion back then.\nTrevor had frowned in annoyance and reiterated that he wouldn't interfere and that they should handle it according to company policy. He had emphasized that they shouldn't bring up Celeste's matters with him again.\nSeeing Zeke's hesitation, Trevor frowned. \"What is it?\"\nZeke snapped out of his thoughts and quickly replied, \"Oh, it's nothing.\"\nSince Trevor was already aware of Celeste's resignation but hadn't brought it up, it was clear that this matter wasn't important to him. So, Zeke decided to proceed as usual and handle the matter according to company regulations.\nWith that resolved, Trevor ended the call.\n\u2026\n\"What are you thinking about?\" At noon, a colleague patted Celeste on the shoulder.\nCeleste came back to her senses and smiled, shaking her head. \"Nothing.\"\n\"Don't you need to call your daughter today?\"\n\"No, not today.\"\nTypically, she called Jordyn twice a day\u2014once at 1:00 am and once at around 12:00 pm.\nHer colleagues at work were aware of this habit. What they didn't know was her daughter was the child she had with the company's CEO.\nAfter work, Celeste went to the supermarket. She bought some groceries and a few potted plants before heading home.\nAfter dinner, she browsed online for information about the upcoming technology exhibition. \nAfter that, she made a call. \"Please reserve a ticket for next month's tech exhibition for me.\"\n\"Are you sure?\" the person on the other end replied coolly. \"The last two times you asked me to reserve tickets, you didn't show up. Do you know how many people's lifelong dream is to get one of those tickets? You wasted them thoughtlessly.\"\nThe annual tech exhibition was a major event in the industry, and tickets were not easily obtainable.\nTheir company had a limited number of slots, and many IT elites working for them eagerly vied for the opportunity to attend it.\n\"If I don't show up to the exhibition this time, I will never ask you to reserve a ticket for me ever again,\" Celeste promised.\nThere was silence on the other end before the line disconnected. \nCeleste knew that he'd agreed. The corners of her mouth tugged upward into a smile. What she hadn't said was that she wanted to return to the company.\nThough she was one of the partners of her tech firm, she had stepped back during its early days to focus on marriage and family. Her decision had disrupted their development plans and cost them many opportunities.\nHer colleagues had been both angry and frustrated with her. Over the years, they had rarely been in contact.\nWhile Celeste was eager to return, she knew she had been out of the industry for too long. If she went back unprepared, she was worried she wouldn't be able to keep up with the company's current pace.\nSo, she planned to spend some time familiarizing herself with the industry's latest developments before making a concrete decision.\nFor the next few days, Celeste focused on her work during office hours and spent her evenings tending to her own matters. She didn't reach out to Jordyn or Trevor, and they didn't contact her either.\nCeleste wasn't surprised. For over half a year, her communication with them had been one-sided. They had only passively responded to her efforts.\n\u2026\nMeanwhile, in Andostan, Jordyn had developed the habit of calling Wynn first thing every morning.\nThat day, she called Wynn right after waking up as usual. However, the call didn't last long before she burst into tears.\nWynn had told her some bad news. \"I'm going back to the country soon.\"\nDevastated, Jordyn finished the call and immediately phoned Trevor. \"Dad, did you know about this?\"\nAt his office, Trevor flipped through some documents. \"Yes.\"\n\"When did you find out?\"\n\"It's been a while.\"\n\"Dad, you're so mean\u2026\" Jordyn hugged her pink stuffed pig and cried loudly. \"I don't want Wynn to leave. If she's not here, I don't want to go to school here anymore. I want to go back too!\"\nTrevor's tone remained even. \"It's already being arranged.\"\nJordyn didn't understand. \"W-What do you mean?\"\n\"We're going back next week.\"\nJordyn jumped out of bed in excitement. \"Really?\"\n\"Yes, really,\" Trevor replied.\n\"Then why didn't Wynn tell me just now?\"\n\"It was just finalized. She doesn't know yet.\"\nJordyn was ecstatic. \"Dad, let's keep this a secret from Wynn. We'll surprise her when we go back to the country, okay?\"\n\"Alright.\"\n\"You're the best, Dad! I love you so much!\"\nAfter hanging up, Jordyn was still overjoyed. She sang and danced on her bed.\nAfter a while, she suddenly thought of Celeste. For the past few days, she had been in a great mood because Celeste hadn't called her. In fact, to avoid talking to Celeste, she had deliberately left home early and even turned off her phone or kept it far away from her after school.\nBut after two days, she was worried that Celeste might get angry if she found out. So, she stopped doing that. To her surprise, Celeste hadn't called at all in the days that followed.\nAt first, she thought Celeste had discovered that she was deliberately avoiding her calls. But then she remembered that based on past experiences, that wasn't very likely. If Celeste knew she had done something wrong, she would immediately ask Jordyn to correct her wrongdoing instead of sulking and not calling.\nAfter all, she was the most important person to Celeste. Jordyn knew that Celeste loved her the most, so she didn't think that Celeste would purposely refrain from calling her simply because she was upset.\nAs Jordyn thought about this, she suddenly missed Celeste. It was the first time in days she had thought about Celeste, and she couldn't resist dialing Celeste's number.\nBut just as the call connected, she remembered that while she would get to see Wynn after returning to the country, Celeste would undoubtedly try every possible way to prevent her from meeting Wynn. She wouldn't be able to see Wynn whenever she wanted like she could now.\nThis thought dampened Jordyn's mood.\nIt was midnight in Celeste's time zone. She was already asleep when she was woken by the call. Upon seeing Jordyn's name on the screen, she was about to answer when the call abruptly disconnected.\nAlthough Celeste had written in her divorce agreement that she would relinquish custody of Jordyn, she still felt a sense of responsibility as her mother. Worried that something might have happened, Celeste immediately called back.\nWhen Jordyn saw the incoming call, she turned her head away and refused to answer.\nCeleste became more concerned and quickly called the landline at the villa.\nHannah answered promptly. After hearing Celeste's concerns, she reassured her, \"Ms. Fleming should be fine. She went to bed late last night and woke up late today. When I checked earlier, she was still asleep. I'll go upstairs to take a look and call you back.\"\nFeeling relieved, Celeste replied, \"Thank you.\"\nWhen Hannah went upstairs, Jordyn was already in the bathroom brushing her teeth.\nAfter Hannah relayed Celeste being worried about her, Jordyn lowered her head and lied, \"I accidentally hit the call button.\"\nHannah believed her and didn't doubt what she said. Seeing that Jordyn was still brushing her teeth, she went back downstairs to update Celeste that Jordyn was fine.\nJordyn watched as Hannah left. She huffed and finally felt a bit better.\nAfter hearing Hannah's reassurance, Celeste felt relieved too. Still, having been abruptly woken, she struggled to fall back asleep. She wasn't in great shape the next morning at work.\nThe envelope containing the divorce agreement was completely forgotten by Trevor after the phone call with Wynn.\nOn the day they returned to the country, Trevor packed the last document into his briefcase and ensured that nothing was left behind before heading downstairs.\n\"All set. Let's go.\"\nThe Lincoln stretch limousine departed from the villa and headed to the airport.\n\u2026\nThat night, at around 10:00 pm, the plane carrying Trevor and Jordyn landed on time. By the time they got home, it was nearly midnight. \nJordyn had fallen asleep before they arrived. When Trevor carried her upstairs, he passed the master bedroom and noticed the door was open, but the room was pitch black.\nAfter putting Jordyn on her bed and tucking her in, he returned to the master bedroom and turned on the light. Then, he glanced at the bed and found that it was empty\u2014Celeste wasn't there.\nJust then, the butler, Peter Hawk, came upstairs with his luggage. \nLoosening his tie, Trevor asked, \"Where is she?\"\nPeter replied, \"Mrs. Fleming is on a business trip.\"\nHalf a month ago, Peter hadn't been around when Celeste had left with her suitcase. The other maids told him that Celeste left with a suitcase, so he had assumed she was traveling for work.\nNow that he thought about it, this was unusual. Celeste rarely went on business trips. Even when she did, they typically lasted only two or three days.\nThis time, she had been gone for over two weeks.\n\"Alright,\" Trevor responded indifferently, asking no further questions.\n...\nThe next day, Celeste unexpectedly ran into Trevor at the company. She hadn't known that Trevor and Jordyn had returned to the country. Caught off guard by their sudden encounter, Celeste froze mid-step.\nTrevor also seemed slightly surprised to see her, but he assumed she had just returned from the business trip and didn't think much of it.\nHe passed by her coldly, his face expressionless. As usual, he treated her like she was a stranger and turned to enter the building.\nIn the past, if Celeste had found out that he'd suddenly come back, she would have been overjoyed. Even if she couldn't throw herself into his arms in such a scenario, she would have been very happy and excited. Her eyes would light up as she greeted him. \nEven if Trevor remained indifferent, she would have smiled and wished him good morning enthusiastically.\nBut now, Celeste merely glanced at his handsome face before lowering her eyes. There was no longer any trace of the joy and excitement she once felt.\nTrevor didn't notice any of this and was already walking away.\nWatching his tall and composed figure disappear into the building, Celeste wondered when he had returned. Since he was back, perhaps the matter of their divorce could soon be addressed.\nHaving resolved to go through with the divorce, Celeste didn't dwell on him further. After she returned to her workstation, she quickly immersed herself in her work.\nHalf an hour later, Zeke called her and instructed her to do something. \"Prepare two cups of coffee and take them to Mr. Fleming's office.\"\nIn the early days of her marriage, Celeste had learned that Trevor enjoyed coffee. In hopes of winning his favor, she had spent a great deal of effort studying how to brew it perfectly. Her efforts had paid off. After tasting her coffee, Trevor began to specifically request it, both at home and at the office.\nWhen she first realized he genuinely liked the coffee she made, Celeste had been thrilled. She naively believed it was the first step toward gaining his approval.\nBut she had underestimated his dislike and wariness of her. While he liked her coffee, that was all he liked. His attitude toward her remained cold and distant.\nEven when he wanted her coffee, he would have Zeke reach out to her. Once the coffee was prepared, someone else would pick it up for him. He never gave her the opportunity to approach him herself.\nOnly on rare occasions when no one else was available did she get the chance to deliver it to his office personally.\nThis time, it seemed she was to take the coffee directly to Trevor herself from Zeke's tone. After brewing the coffee, Celeste placed the cups on a tray and carried them to his office.\nThe door to his office was ajar.\nAs she approached and was about to knock on the door politely, she saw Wynn sitting on Trevor's lap. The two of them seemed to be locked in a passionate kiss.\nCeleste stopped in her tracks, her face turning pale.\nUpon seeing her, Wynn shot up from Trevor's lap, looking flustered.\nTrevor's expression darkened, and he questioned in an icy tone, \"Who allowed you to come in?\"\n..."

                  "text": "If your husband stayed cold around you, then his passion might have found someone else.\nCeleste looked into the restaurant - her husband wrapped his arms around his first love dotingly, while her daughter was giggling besides...she finally decided to let go.\nThe cheating husband, along with the daughter calling another woman \"mom\"\u2014she would throw them both out of her life!\n\nAfter seven years of marriage, my husband, Trevor, fell for another woman\u2014even our daughter wanted her as her new mom.\nI scoffed at the years I\u2019d wasted and handed him the divorce papers. Yet he dropped his usual aloofness, slamming me against the wall,\n\u201cDivorce? Not a chance.\u201d\n***\nWhen Celeste Rodriguez landed at the airport in Andostan, it was already past 9:00 pm.\nIt was her birthday. Her phone buzzed with messages from colleagues and friends\u2014but not a single one from her husband, Trevor Fleming.\nCeleste's smile faded.\nBy the time she reached the villa, it was already past 10:00 pm.\nHannah Lynd, the housekeeper looked startled. \"Mrs. Fleming... what a surprise.\"\n\"Where are Trevor and Jo?\" Celeste asked, handing over her luggage.\n\"Mr. Fleming isn\u2019t back yet. Miss Jordyn\u2019s upstairs playing.\"\nCeleste climbed the stairs. In her room, Jordyn sat in pajamas at her desk, completely absorbed.\n\"Jo?\" Celeste called.\nJordyn turned, her eyes lighting up. In a happy tone, she greeted, \"Mom!\"\nBut then she quickly got back to what she was doing earlier.\nCeleste walked over and hugged her tight, planting a kiss on her cheek. Yet the little one pushed her away and squirmed. \"Mom, I\u2019m busy.\" \nIt had been two months since Celeste last saw Jordyn. She missed her so much that no amount of kisses felt enough. She wanted to talk to Jordyn.\nShe noticed the necklace Jordyn was threading. \"Jo, are you making a seashell necklace?\"\n\"Mm-hm!\" Jordyn perked up visibly. \"Wynn's birthday is in a week. Dad and I picked and polished these ourselves. Pretty, right?\"\nCeleste\u2019s throat tightened. Jordyn didn\u2019t look up, only added brightly, \"Dad even got her a custom gift, tomorrow\u2014\"\nCeleste felt a pang in her chest and couldn't hold back anymore. \"Jo\u2026 Do you remember it's my birthday today?\"\n\"Huh?\" Jordyn glanced up briefly, then quickly looked back down at the string of beads in her hands, She complained, \"Mom, don\u2019t talk, Look, I messed up the bead order\u2014\"\nCeleste stood there in silence for a while, but Jordyn never looked back up. Finally, Celeste pursed her lips and left the room without another word.\nDownstairs, Hannah said, \"I called Mr. Fleming. He said he\u2019s busy tonight and you should rest first.\"\n\"I see.\" Celeste replied softly.\nShe hesitated, then called Trevor. It rang for a while before he answered.\nhis tone was indifferent as usual. \"I'm busy. Let's talk tomorrow\u2014\"\nA woman\u2019s voice chimed in: \"Trevor, who is it?\"\nWynn.\nCeleste gripped the phone tighter.\n\"No one important,\" Trevor answered her.\nBefore Celeste could say anything, Trevor had already hung up.\nCeleste stared at the screen. Two or three months apart, and this was all he had for her.\nAfter so many years of marriage, he\u2019d always been cold. Distant. Impatient. \nShe had got used to chasing after him, calling again, begging for time. Yet tonight, she didn\u2019t bother. \nPerhaps she was just too tired.\n\nThe next morning, Celeste thought it over and decided to call Trevor again.\nThere was a time difference of about 17 or 18 hours between Andostan and their home country. In Andostan, today was her actual birthday.\nShe didn\u2019t just come here for Jordyn. She wanted one thing: a family meal. Her only birthday wish.\nYet, Trevor didn\u2019t answer.\nA long time later, he texted: What\u2019s up?\nShe replied: Lunch today? Just the three of us.\nTrevor answered: Okay. Send the address.\nAlright, she typed back.\nThat was it. No acknowledgment. No \u201cHappy birthday.\u201d She wasn\u2019t surprised. But it still stung.\nAs she headed downstairs, she overheard Jordyn talking with Hannah.\n\"Aren't you happy that Mrs. Fleming is here, sweetie?\" Hannah asked.\n\"Dad and I promised to take Wynn to the beach tomorrow. If Mom comes, it'll be weird. She\u2019s always mean to Wynn.\"\n\"Mrs. Fleming is still your mom, sweetie. That\u2019s hurtful.\"\n\"I know, but Dad and I like Wynn more. Can't Wynn be my mom instead?\"\nCeleste froze.\nShe had raised Jordyn herself most of the time. But over the past two years, the more time Jordyn spent with Trevor, the more attached she became to him. When Trevor came to Andostan to expand his business last year, Jordyn had insisted on coming along.\nCeleste was reluctant and had hoped Jordyn would stay by her side. But she couldn't bear to see Jordyn upset, so she agreed.\nAnd now, Jordyn didn\u2019t even want her as her mom anymore.\nCeleste stood frozen in place, her face pale. To think that she had pushed aside her work to come to Andostan with the intention of spending more time with Jordyn.\nNow, it seemed unnecessary.\nShe walked back to her room, pale and quiet, then repacked the gifts she\u2019d brought.\nLater, Hannah texted: Madame, I took Jordyn out. Let me know if you need anything.\nCeleste sat on the bed, feeling hollow and lost inside. She had abandoned her work and made this trip, only to find no one wanted her here.\nHer arrival was nothing but a joke.\n\nAfter a long while, she left the villa. Aimlessly, she drove around in this foreign yet familiar country.\nBy noon, she remembered she had planned to have lunch with Trevor and Jordyn. As she recalled what she had overheard in the morning, she hesitated about whether to go home and pick up Jordyn. \nThen, a text from Trevor came: Something came up. Lunch\u2019s canceled.\nCeleste stared at it.\nShe should\u2019ve known. Trevor always canceled on her.  His work, friends, and everything else always came before her, his wife.\nOnce, she\u2019d cry. Today, she just felt\u2026 empty.\nCeleste was at an utter loss. She had come all this way excitedly only to be met with indifference from both Trevor and Jordyn.\nAimlessly, she drove around. Eventually, she found herself outside an old favorite restaurant which she and Trevor used to frequent.\nJust as she was about to walk in, she saw them.\nTrevor. Jordyn. Wynn.\nWynn sat next to Jordyn, laughing, feeding the little one the pastries she had taken a bite out of. Jordyn giggled, with her legs swinging around happily. Trevor smiled as he served food to both of them, but his gaze never left Wynn.\nWhat a happy family of three!\nSo this was his \"something came up.\"\nAnd this was the daughter she had carried for ten long months and nearly lost her life to bring into this world.\nCeleste laughed humorlessly. She stood there watching for a long time. Finally, she turned and drove away.\n\nBack at the villa, Celeste drafted the divorce agreement.\nTrevor had been her teenage dream\u2014but he had never truly seen her. If not for that one night and his grandfather Arnold Fleming\u2019s pressure, he never would\u2019ve married her. She thought loving him hard enough would be enough, but seven years proved otherwise.\nFor a long time, she felt lucky to have Jo\u2014her only source of comfort. But now, even Jo didn\u2019t seem to want her.\nThat was it.\nShe was done\u2014with the marriage, the lies, the thankless role of wife and mother. It was time to leave all this behind\u2014and reclaim the promising life she'd given up!\nShe sealed the divorce papers, handed them to Hannah, then grabbed her suitcase and walked out, bound for the airport. On the way, she finally dialed the number she\u2019d been avoiding for months.\nThe line rang once. Twice. A click.\n\u201cHello?\u201d\nShe took a breath, steady and sharp.\u201cThat offer still stand?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d\n...\nAt around 9:00 pm, Trevor and Jordyn returned home.\nJordyn clung to the hem of Trevor's coat and got out of the car sluggishly. Because Celeste was at home, she was reluctant to return that night.\nBut Wynn had said that Celeste came specifically to be with her and Trevor, and if they didn't return, she would be sad. Trevor also said that if they didn't go home that night, Celeste would definitely insist on joining them on their outing to the sea the next day.\nReluctantly, Jordyn agreed to come home.\nStill worried, she muttered gloomily, \"Dad, what if Mom insists on tagging along with us tomorrow?\"\n\"She won't,\" Trevor replied confidently.\nIn all the years they'd been married, Celeste had always tried to find ways to spend more time with him. But she was also sensible. As long as he made his stance clear, she wouldn't dare make him upset.\nIn Jordyn's memory, Celeste always listened to Trevor. Since he said she wouldn't, she felt reassured. As a result, her mood lifted. She made her way into the villa cheerfully and told Hannah she wanted to take a bath.\n\"Sure, sure,\" Hannah replied to Jordyn. Then, she remembered Celeste's instructions and handed an envelope to Trevor. \"Mr. Fleming, this is from Mrs. Fleming. She asked me to give it to you.\"\nTrevor took the envelope and asked casually, \"Where is she?\"\n\"Mrs. Fleming packed up and went back to the country this afternoon. Didn't you know?\" Hannah responded.\nTrevor paused mid-step as he was heading upstairs. He turned back, feeling a little surprised. \"Has she gone back?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nWhy had Celeste suddenly come to Andostan? Trevor hadn't given her a chance to tell him about it. He hadn't cared to ask either. Upon learning she'd left, he didn't dwell on it.\nJordyn was a little surprised too. When she heard the news, she felt a small twinge of disappointment. She'd been thinking that even if Celeste didn't join them for the outing tomorrow, it might be nice to have her around at home in the evening.\nPolishing the seashells made her hands hurt\u2014she had been counting on Celeste's help in finishing the necklace.\nThough it had been months since Trevor and Celeste had seen each other, she had made the effort to visit but only to leave without seeing him in person. Hannah recalled Celeste's grim expression as she left and thought that things felt a little off.\nShe couldn't help but say, \"Mr. Fleming, Mrs. Fleming looked upset when she left. She seemed angry.\"\nHannah had assumed Celeste's sudden departure was due to an urgent matter. Upon realizing Trevor hadn't known she'd left, she began to feel something was amiss.\n\"Angry?\" Trevor repeated in his mind. \nIn his presence, Celeste had always been patient and accommodating. So, she could get angry too? This was new.\nTrevor smiled faintly and responded to Hannah perfunctorily before heading upstairs.\nBack in the bedroom, he was about to open the envelope Celeste had left when Wynn called. After answering the call, he tossed the envelope aside and walked out the door.\nA short while later, the envelope slipped off the bed onto the floor.\nThat night, Trevor didn't return home.\nThe next day, Hannah noticed the envelope on the floor when she was cleaning. Recognizing it as the one Celeste had asked her to hand over, she assumed Trevor had already seen it and placed it in a nearby drawer.\n\u2026\nRight after getting off the plane, Celeste went home and began packing her belongings. She had accumulated quite a few things in the house since she'd been living there for six years, after all. But she only took a few sets of clothes, two sets of daily necessities, and some books that were related to her field of study back in college.\nAfter their marriage, Trevor had been depositing money for her and Jordyn into two separate accounts every month. One account was hers, and the other was Jordyn's.\nHowever, Celeste was used to spending her own money only. She had never touched the money in Jordyn's account. Because she loved Trevor, whenever she went shopping and saw clothes, shoes, cufflinks, or ties that suited him, she couldn't help but buy them.\nIn contrast, she didn't have many expenses on a daily basis because all she did was go to work. Her heart and mind were always focused on Trevor and Jordyn. She wanted to give them the best of everything.\nMost of the money Trevor deposited into her bank account was spent on him and Jordyn.\nGiven this spending pattern, there shouldn't have been much money left in Celeste's account. But over the past year, her opportunities to buy things for Trevor and Jordyn had decreased significantly because they were in Andostan.\nNow, there were over three million dollars in her account. That amount might not matter to Trevor, but to her, it was no small sum. And since it was her money, Celeste didn't hesitate to transfer it out.\nShe left both cards behind, dragged her suitcase out the door, and didn't look back.\nCeleste had an apartment near her workplace, which was a little over 1,100 square feet. She'd bought it four years ago to support a friend who had been struggling to meet their sales targets. She had never lived there before.\nNow, the apartment came in handy. She had it cleaned regularly, so it wasn't dirty. After a quick tidy-up, it was ready to move in.\nAfter a long day, Celeste washed up and went to bed around 10:00 pm.\n\u2026\nThe shrill sound of an alarm jolted Celeste awake. Startled, her mind went blank for a moment.\nWhen she came to her senses, she realized that while it was 1:00 am here, it was 7:00 am in Andostan, where Trevor and Jordyn were. This was their usual breakfast time.\nEver since Jordyn had gone to live with Trevor in Andostan, Celeste had developed the habit of calling her at this time every day. As she was always exhausted from work and was used to going to bed early, she had set this alarm to ensure she wouldn't miss the call.\nAt first, Jordyn hadn't adapted well to living in Andostan and had missed her terribly. She had called Celeste constantly. But as time went on, the calls that used to be full of yearning and dependence had grown perfunctory and impatient.\nThe alarm was no longer necessary. She just hadn't been able to let go.\nSmiling bitterly, Celeste deleted the alarm and turned off her phone before going back to sleep.\n\u2026\nMeanwhile, Trevor and Jordyn were nearly done with breakfast. Though he knew Celeste usually called Jordyn at this time, he wasn't always home and hadn't paid much attention to the routine.\nHe noticed that Celeste hadn't called that day. The fact registered in his mind, but he didn't care. After finishing breakfast, he went upstairs to change.\nJordyn, finding Celeste increasingly annoying, had grown less fond of their calls. Upon realizing that Celeste hadn't called yet, she figured something must have come up.\nShe grabbed her backpack and bolted for the door.\nHannah hurried after her. \"Ms. Fleming, it's still early. There's no rush!\"\nJordyn ignored her and ran to the car happily. She was thrilled that Celeste hadn't called on time that day. If she stayed home, she might still have to talk to Celeste later. Well, she didn't want that!\n\u2026\nAfter getting married to Trevor, Celeste had joined Fleming Group for his sake. Now that she was planning to divorce him, she saw no reason to stay.\nThe next morning, Celeste handed her resignation letter to Zeke Jackson after arriving at the office.\nZeke was one of Trevor's personal secretaries. When he saw Celeste's resignation letter, he was extremely surprised.\nHe was one of the few in the company who knew about the relationship between Celeste and Trevor.\nAnyone familiar with Trevor knew that he didn't love Celeste. So, he had been cold to her and rarely went home after their marriage.\nTo get closer to and win over Trevor, Celeste had chosen to work at Fleming Group.\nHer initial goal was to become his personal secretary, but Trevor refused vehemently. Even when Arnold stepped in, he couldn't get Trevor to agree. In the end, Celeste had to settle for a position in the secretarial team, becoming one of Trevor's many ordinary secretaries.\nAt first, Zeke had worried that Celeste's presence in the secretarial team would create chaos. But to his surprise, she didn't bring them any trouble. Although Celeste used her position to get closer to Trevor, she was mindful of her timing and never overstepped her boundaries. \nOn the contrary, she worked diligently and performed exceptionally well, hoping to gain Trevor's respect. Whether during her pregnancy, childbirth, or any other time, she strictly adhered to company policies and never sought special treatment.\nOver the years, Celeste rose to become the head of the secretarial team. Zeke had observed her feelings for Trevor from the sidelines all the while. To be honest, he had never imagined she would resign one day. He felt skeptical about her willingly giving up her position.\nSomething must have happened between Celeste and Trevor for her to resign now. Zeke understood that this was something he wasn't privy to\u2014it must be something significant enough for Trevor to have ordered her to resign.\nWhile he found it a pity, Zeke maintained a professional tone. \"I acknowledge that I've received your resignation letter. I'll arrange for someone to take over your duties as soon as possible.\"\n\"Alright.\" Celeste nodded and returned to her workstation.\nAfter working for a while, Zeke started an online meeting with Trevor to report on company matters. As the conversation neared its end, he suddenly remembered Celeste's resignation. \n\"Oh, Mr. Fleming, there's one more thing\u2014\"\nAlthough Zeke had told Celeste he would quickly arrange for someone to take over her position, he wanted to gauge Trevor's thoughts on the matter first. If Trevor wanted Celeste out immediately, he would make the arrangements right away.\nBut as the words left his mouth, he remembered that when Celeste first joined the company, Trevor had explicitly stated that all matters regarding her employment should be handled per company regulations. He made it clear that there was no need to report anything to him since he wouldn't concern himself with her.\nAnd indeed, over the years, Trevor had never actively inquired about Celeste's work at the company.\nEven when he encountered her at work, he treated her like she was a complete stranger.\nWhen Celeste was set to be promoted a couple of years ago, the team had hesitated. Everyone was aware of Trevor's dislike for her. They had even brought it up with him to gauge his opinion back then.\nTrevor had frowned in annoyance and reiterated that he wouldn't interfere and that they should handle it according to company policy. He had emphasized that they shouldn't bring up Celeste's matters with him again.\nSeeing Zeke's hesitation, Trevor frowned. \"What is it?\"\nZeke snapped out of his thoughts and quickly replied, \"Oh, it's nothing.\"\nSince Trevor was already aware of Celeste's resignation but hadn't brought it up, it was clear that this matter wasn't important to him. So, Zeke decided to proceed as usual and handle the matter according to company regulations.\nWith that resolved, Trevor ended the call.\n\u2026\n\"What are you thinking about?\" At noon, a colleague patted Celeste on the shoulder.\nCeleste came back to her senses and smiled, shaking her head. \"Nothing.\"\n\"Don't you need to call your daughter today?\"\n\"No, not today.\"\nTypically, she called Jordyn twice a day\u2014once at 1:00 am and once at around 12:00 pm.\nHer colleagues at work were aware of this habit. What they didn't know was her daughter was the child she had with the company's CEO.\nAfter work, Celeste went to the supermarket. She bought some groceries and a few potted plants before heading home.\nAfter dinner, she browsed online for information about the upcoming technology exhibition. \nAfter that, she made a call. \"Please reserve a ticket for next month's tech exhibition for me.\"\n\"Are you sure?\" the person on the other end replied coolly. \"The last two times you asked me to reserve tickets, you didn't show up. Do you know how many people's lifelong dream is to get one of those tickets? You wasted them thoughtlessly.\"\nThe annual tech exhibition was a major event in the industry, and tickets were not easily obtainable.\nTheir company had a limited number of slots, and many IT elites working for them eagerly vied for the opportunity to attend it.\n\"If I don't show up to the exhibition this time, I will never ask you to reserve a ticket for me ever again,\" Celeste promised.\nThere was silence on the other end before the line disconnected. \nCeleste knew that he'd agreed. The corners of her mouth tugged upward into a smile. What she hadn't said was that she wanted to return to the company.\nThough she was one of the partners of her tech firm, she had stepped back during its early days to focus on marriage and family. Her decision had disrupted their development plans and cost them many opportunities.\nHer colleagues had been both angry and frustrated with her. Over the years, they had rarely been in contact.\nWhile Celeste was eager to return, she knew she had been out of the industry for too long. If she went back unprepared, she was worried she wouldn't be able to keep up with the company's current pace.\nSo, she planned to spend some time familiarizing herself with the industry's latest developments before making a concrete decision.\nFor the next few days, Celeste focused on her work during office hours and spent her evenings tending to her own matters. She didn't reach out to Jordyn or Trevor, and they didn't contact her either.\nCeleste wasn't surprised. For over half a year, her communication with them had been one-sided. They had only passively responded to her efforts.\n\u2026\nMeanwhile, in Andostan, Jordyn had developed the habit of calling Wynn first thing every morning.\nThat day, she called Wynn right after waking up as usual. However, the call didn't last long before she burst into tears.\nWynn had told her some bad news. \"I'm going back to the country soon.\"\nDevastated, Jordyn finished the call and immediately phoned Trevor. \"Dad, did you know about this?\"\nAt his office, Trevor flipped through some documents. \"Yes.\"\n\"When did you find out?\"\n\"It's been a while.\"\n\"Dad, you're so mean\u2026\" Jordyn hugged her pink stuffed pig and cried loudly. \"I don't want Wynn to leave. If she's not here, I don't want to go to school here anymore. I want to go back too!\"\nTrevor's tone remained even. \"It's already being arranged.\"\nJordyn didn't understand. \"W-What do you mean?\"\n\"We're going back next week.\"\nJordyn jumped out of bed in excitement. \"Really?\"\n\"Yes, really,\" Trevor replied.\n\"Then why didn't Wynn tell me just now?\"\n\"It was just finalized. She doesn't know yet.\"\nJordyn was ecstatic. \"Dad, let's keep this a secret from Wynn. We'll surprise her when we go back to the country, okay?\"\n\"Alright.\"\n\"You're the best, Dad! I love you so much!\"\nAfter hanging up, Jordyn was still overjoyed. She sang and danced on her bed.\nAfter a while, she suddenly thought of Celeste. For the past few days, she had been in a great mood because Celeste hadn't called her. In fact, to avoid talking to Celeste, she had deliberately left home early and even turned off her phone or kept it far away from her after school.\nBut after two days, she was worried that Celeste might get angry if she found out. So, she stopped doing that. To her surprise, Celeste hadn't called at all in the days that followed.\nAt first, she thought Celeste had discovered that she was deliberately avoiding her calls. But then she remembered that based on past experiences, that wasn't very likely. If Celeste knew she had done something wrong, she would immediately ask Jordyn to correct her wrongdoing instead of sulking and not calling.\nAfter all, she was the most important person to Celeste. Jordyn knew that Celeste loved her the most, so she didn't think that Celeste would purposely refrain from calling her simply because she was upset.\nAs Jordyn thought about this, she suddenly missed Celeste. It was the first time in days she had thought about Celeste, and she couldn't resist dialing Celeste's number.\nBut just as the call connected, she remembered that while she would get to see Wynn after returning to the country, Celeste would undoubtedly try every possible way to prevent her from meeting Wynn. She wouldn't be able to see Wynn whenever she wanted like she could now.\nThis thought dampened Jordyn's mood.\nIt was midnight in Celeste's time zone. She was already asleep when she was woken by the call. Upon seeing Jordyn's name on the screen, she was about to answer when the call abruptly disconnected.\nAlthough Celeste had written in her divorce agreement that she would relinquish custody of Jordyn, she still felt a sense of responsibility as her mother. Worried that something might have happened, Celeste immediately called back.\nWhen Jordyn saw the incoming call, she turned her head away and refused to answer.\nCeleste became more concerned and quickly called the landline at the villa.\nHannah answered promptly. After hearing Celeste's concerns, she reassured her, \"Ms. Fleming should be fine. She went to bed late last night and woke up late today. When I checked earlier, she was still asleep. I'll go upstairs to take a look and call you back.\"\nFeeling relieved, Celeste replied, \"Thank you.\"\nWhen Hannah went upstairs, Jordyn was already in the bathroom brushing her teeth.\nAfter Hannah relayed Celeste being worried about her, Jordyn lowered her head and lied, \"I accidentally hit the call button.\"\nHannah believed her and didn't doubt what she said. Seeing that Jordyn was still brushing her teeth, she went back downstairs to update Celeste that Jordyn was fine.\nJordyn watched as Hannah left. She huffed and finally felt a bit better.\nAfter hearing Hannah's reassurance, Celeste felt relieved too. Still, having been abruptly woken, she struggled to fall back asleep. She wasn't in great shape the next morning at work.\nThe envelope containing the divorce agreement was completely forgotten by Trevor after the phone call with Wynn.\nOn the day they returned to the country, Trevor packed the last document into his briefcase and ensured that nothing was left behind before heading downstairs.\n\"All set. Let's go.\"\nThe Lincoln stretch limousine departed from the villa and headed to the airport.\n\u2026\nThat night, at around 10:00 pm, the plane carrying Trevor and Jordyn landed on time. By the time they got home, it was nearly midnight. \nJordyn had fallen asleep before they arrived. When Trevor carried her upstairs, he passed the master bedroom and noticed the door was open, but the room was pitch black.\nAfter putting Jordyn on her bed and tucking her in, he returned to the master bedroom and turned on the light. Then, he glanced at the bed and found that it was empty\u2014Celeste wasn't there.\nJust then, the butler, Peter Hawk, came upstairs with his luggage. \nLoosening his tie, Trevor asked, \"Where is she?\"\nPeter replied, \"Mrs. Fleming is on a business trip.\"\nHalf a month ago, Peter hadn't been around when Celeste had left with her suitcase. The other maids told him that Celeste left with a suitcase, so he had assumed she was traveling for work.\nNow that he thought about it, this was unusual. Celeste rarely went on business trips. Even when she did, they typically lasted only two or three days.\nThis time, she had been gone for over two weeks.\n\"Alright,\" Trevor responded indifferently, asking no further questions.\n...\nThe next day, Celeste unexpectedly ran into Trevor at the company. She hadn't known that Trevor and Jordyn had returned to the country. Caught off guard by their sudden encounter, Celeste froze mid-step.\nTrevor also seemed slightly surprised to see her, but he assumed she had just returned from the business trip and didn't think much of it.\nHe passed by her coldly, his face expressionless. As usual, he treated her like she was a stranger and turned to enter the building.\nIn the past, if Celeste had found out that he'd suddenly come back, she would have been overjoyed. Even if she couldn't throw herself into his arms in such a scenario, she would have been very happy and excited. Her eyes would light up as she greeted him. \nEven if Trevor remained indifferent, she would have smiled and wished him good morning enthusiastically.\nBut now, Celeste merely glanced at his handsome face before lowering her eyes. There was no longer any trace of the joy and excitement she once felt.\nTrevor didn't notice any of this and was already walking away.\nWatching his tall and composed figure disappear into the building, Celeste wondered when he had returned. Since he was back, perhaps the matter of their divorce could soon be addressed.\nHaving resolved to go through with the divorce, Celeste didn't dwell on him further. After she returned to her workstation, she quickly immersed herself in her work.\nHalf an hour later, Zeke called her and instructed her to do something. \"Prepare two cups of coffee and take them to Mr. Fleming's office.\"\nIn the early days of her marriage, Celeste had learned that Trevor enjoyed coffee. In hopes of winning his favor, she had spent a great deal of effort studying how to brew it perfectly. Her efforts had paid off. After tasting her coffee, Trevor began to specifically request it, both at home and at the office.\nWhen she first realized he genuinely liked the coffee she made, Celeste had been thrilled. She naively believed it was the first step toward gaining his approval.\nBut she had underestimated his dislike and wariness of her. While he liked her coffee, that was all he liked. His attitude toward her remained cold and distant.\nEven when he wanted her coffee, he would have Zeke reach out to her. Once the coffee was prepared, someone else would pick it up for him. He never gave her the opportunity to approach him herself.\nOnly on rare occasions when no one else was available did she get the chance to deliver it to his office personally.\nThis time, it seemed she was to take the coffee directly to Trevor herself from Zeke's tone. After brewing the coffee, Celeste placed the cups on a tray and carried them to his office.\nThe door to his office was ajar.\nAs she approached and was about to knock on the door politely, she saw Wynn sitting on Trevor's lap. The two of them seemed to be locked in a passionate kiss.\nCeleste stopped in her tracks, her face turning pale.\nUpon seeing her, Wynn shot up from Trevor's lap, looking flustered.\nTrevor's expression darkened, and he questioned in an icy tone, \"Who allowed you to come in?\"\n..."

                  "text": "If your husband stayed cold around you, then his passion might have found someone else.\nCeleste looked into the restaurant - her husband wrapped his arms around his first love dotingly, while her daughter was giggling besides...she finally decided to let go.\nThe cheating husband, along with the daughter calling another woman \"mom\"\u2014she would throw them both out of her life!\n\nAfter seven years of marriage, my husband, Trevor, fell for another woman\u2014even our daughter wanted her as her new mom.\nI scoffed at the years I\u2019d wasted and handed him the divorce papers. Yet he dropped his usual aloofness, slamming me against the wall,\n\u201cDivorce? Not a chance.\u201d\n***\nWhen Celeste Rodriguez landed at the airport in Andostan, it was already past 9:00 pm.\nIt was her birthday. Her phone buzzed with messages from colleagues and friends\u2014but not a single one from her husband, Trevor Fleming.\nCeleste's smile faded.\nBy the time she reached the villa, it was already past 10:00 pm.\nHannah Lynd, the housekeeper looked startled. \"Mrs. Fleming... what a surprise.\"\n\"Where are Trevor and Jo?\" Celeste asked, handing over her luggage.\n\"Mr. Fleming isn\u2019t back yet. Miss Jordyn\u2019s upstairs playing.\"\nCeleste climbed the stairs. In her room, Jordyn sat in pajamas at her desk, completely absorbed.\n\"Jo?\" Celeste called.\nJordyn turned, her eyes lighting up. In a happy tone, she greeted, \"Mom!\"\nBut then she quickly got back to what she was doing earlier.\nCeleste walked over and hugged her tight, planting a kiss on her cheek. Yet the little one pushed her away and squirmed. \"Mom, I\u2019m busy.\" \nIt had been two months since Celeste last saw Jordyn. She missed her so much that no amount of kisses felt enough. She wanted to talk to Jordyn.\nShe noticed the necklace Jordyn was threading. \"Jo, are you making a seashell necklace?\"\n\"Mm-hm!\" Jordyn perked up visibly. \"Wynn's birthday is in a week. Dad and I picked and polished these ourselves. Pretty, right?\"\nCeleste\u2019s throat tightened. Jordyn didn\u2019t look up, only added brightly, \"Dad even got her a custom gift, tomorrow\u2014\"\nCeleste felt a pang in her chest and couldn't hold back anymore. \"Jo\u2026 Do you remember it's my birthday today?\"\n\"Huh?\" Jordyn glanced up briefly, then quickly looked back down at the string of beads in her hands, She complained, \"Mom, don\u2019t talk, Look, I messed up the bead order\u2014\"\nCeleste stood there in silence for a while, but Jordyn never looked back up. Finally, Celeste pursed her lips and left the room without another word.\nDownstairs, Hannah said, \"I called Mr. Fleming. He said he\u2019s busy tonight and you should rest first.\"\n\"I see.\" Celeste replied softly.\nShe hesitated, then called Trevor. It rang for a while before he answered.\nhis tone was indifferent as usual. \"I'm busy. Let's talk tomorrow\u2014\"\nA woman\u2019s voice chimed in: \"Trevor, who is it?\"\nWynn.\nCeleste gripped the phone tighter.\n\"No one important,\" Trevor answered her.\nBefore Celeste could say anything, Trevor had already hung up.\nCeleste stared at the screen. Two or three months apart, and this was all he had for her.\nAfter so many years of marriage, he\u2019d always been cold. Distant. Impatient. \nShe had got used to chasing after him, calling again, begging for time. Yet tonight, she didn\u2019t bother. \nPerhaps she was just too tired.\n\nThe next morning, Celeste thought it over and decided to call Trevor again.\nThere was a time difference of about 17 or 18 hours between Andostan and their home country. In Andostan, today was her actual birthday.\nShe didn\u2019t just come here for Jordyn. She wanted one thing: a family meal. Her only birthday wish.\nYet, Trevor didn\u2019t answer.\nA long time later, he texted: What\u2019s up?\nShe replied: Lunch today? Just the three of us.\nTrevor answered: Okay. Send the address.\nAlright, she typed back.\nThat was it. No acknowledgment. No \u201cHappy birthday.\u201d She wasn\u2019t surprised. But it still stung.\nAs she headed downstairs, she overheard Jordyn talking with Hannah.\n\"Aren't you happy that Mrs. Fleming is here, sweetie?\" Hannah asked.\n\"Dad and I promised to take Wynn to the beach tomorrow. If Mom comes, it'll be weird. She\u2019s always mean to Wynn.\"\n\"Mrs. Fleming is still your mom, sweetie. That\u2019s hurtful.\"\n\"I know, but Dad and I like Wynn more. Can't Wynn be my mom instead?\"\nCeleste froze.\nShe had raised Jordyn herself most of the time. But over the past two years, the more time Jordyn spent with Trevor, the more attached she became to him. When Trevor came to Andostan to expand his business last year, Jordyn had insisted on coming along.\nCeleste was reluctant and had hoped Jordyn would stay by her side. But she couldn't bear to see Jordyn upset, so she agreed.\nAnd now, Jordyn didn\u2019t even want her as her mom anymore.\nCeleste stood frozen in place, her face pale. To think that she had pushed aside her work to come to Andostan with the intention of spending more time with Jordyn.\nNow, it seemed unnecessary.\nShe walked back to her room, pale and quiet, then repacked the gifts she\u2019d brought.\nLater, Hannah texted: Madame, I took Jordyn out. Let me know if you need anything.\nCeleste sat on the bed, feeling hollow and lost inside. She had abandoned her work and made this trip, only to find no one wanted her here.\nHer arrival was nothing but a joke.\n\nAfter a long while, she left the villa. Aimlessly, she drove around in this foreign yet familiar country.\nBy noon, she remembered she had planned to have lunch with Trevor and Jordyn. As she recalled what she had overheard in the morning, she hesitated about whether to go home and pick up Jordyn. \nThen, a text from Trevor came: Something came up. Lunch\u2019s canceled.\nCeleste stared at it.\nShe should\u2019ve known. Trevor always canceled on her.  His work, friends, and everything else always came before her, his wife.\nOnce, she\u2019d cry. Today, she just felt\u2026 empty.\nCeleste was at an utter loss. She had come all this way excitedly only to be met with indifference from both Trevor and Jordyn.\nAimlessly, she drove around. Eventually, she found herself outside an old favorite restaurant which she and Trevor used to frequent.\nJust as she was about to walk in, she saw them.\nTrevor. Jordyn. Wynn.\nWynn sat next to Jordyn, laughing, feeding the little one the pastries she had taken a bite out of. Jordyn giggled, with her legs swinging around happily. Trevor smiled as he served food to both of them, but his gaze never left Wynn.\nWhat a happy family of three!\nSo this was his \"something came up.\"\nAnd this was the daughter she had carried for ten long months and nearly lost her life to bring into this world.\nCeleste laughed humorlessly. She stood there watching for a long time. Finally, she turned and drove away.\n\nBack at the villa, Celeste drafted the divorce agreement.\nTrevor had been her teenage dream\u2014but he had never truly seen her. If not for that one night and his grandfather Arnold Fleming\u2019s pressure, he never would\u2019ve married her. She thought loving him hard enough would be enough, but seven years proved otherwise.\nFor a long time, she felt lucky to have Jo\u2014her only source of comfort. But now, even Jo didn\u2019t seem to want her.\nThat was it.\nShe was done\u2014with the marriage, the lies, the thankless role of wife and mother. It was time to leave all this behind\u2014and reclaim the promising life she'd given up!\nShe sealed the divorce papers, handed them to Hannah, then grabbed her suitcase and walked out, bound for the airport. On the way, she finally dialed the number she\u2019d been avoiding for months.\nThe line rang once. Twice. A click.\n\u201cHello?\u201d\nShe took a breath, steady and sharp.\u201cThat offer still stand?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d\n...\nAt around 9:00 pm, Trevor and Jordyn returned home.\nJordyn clung to the hem of Trevor's coat and got out of the car sluggishly. Because Celeste was at home, she was reluctant to return that night.\nBut Wynn had said that Celeste came specifically to be with her and Trevor, and if they didn't return, she would be sad. Trevor also said that if they didn't go home that night, Celeste would definitely insist on joining them on their outing to the sea the next day.\nReluctantly, Jordyn agreed to come home.\nStill worried, she muttered gloomily, \"Dad, what if Mom insists on tagging along with us tomorrow?\"\n\"She won't,\" Trevor replied confidently.\nIn all the years they'd been married, Celeste had always tried to find ways to spend more time with him. But she was also sensible. As long as he made his stance clear, she wouldn't dare make him upset.\nIn Jordyn's memory, Celeste always listened to Trevor. Since he said she wouldn't, she felt reassured. As a result, her mood lifted. She made her way into the villa cheerfully and told Hannah she wanted to take a bath.\n\"Sure, sure,\" Hannah replied to Jordyn. Then, she remembered Celeste's instructions and handed an envelope to Trevor. \"Mr. Fleming, this is from Mrs. Fleming. She asked me to give it to you.\"\nTrevor took the envelope and asked casually, \"Where is she?\"\n\"Mrs. Fleming packed up and went back to the country this afternoon. Didn't you know?\" Hannah responded.\nTrevor paused mid-step as he was heading upstairs. He turned back, feeling a little surprised. \"Has she gone back?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nWhy had Celeste suddenly come to Andostan? Trevor hadn't given her a chance to tell him about it. He hadn't cared to ask either. Upon learning she'd left, he didn't dwell on it.\nJordyn was a little surprised too. When she heard the news, she felt a small twinge of disappointment. She'd been thinking that even if Celeste didn't join them for the outing tomorrow, it might be nice to have her around at home in the evening.\nPolishing the seashells made her hands hurt\u2014she had been counting on Celeste's help in finishing the necklace.\nThough it had been months since Trevor and Celeste had seen each other, she had made the effort to visit but only to leave without seeing him in person. Hannah recalled Celeste's grim expression as she left and thought that things felt a little off.\nShe couldn't help but say, \"Mr. Fleming, Mrs. Fleming looked upset when she left. She seemed angry.\"\nHannah had assumed Celeste's sudden departure was due to an urgent matter. Upon realizing Trevor hadn't known she'd left, she began to feel something was amiss.\n\"Angry?\" Trevor repeated in his mind. \nIn his presence, Celeste had always been patient and accommodating. So, she could get angry too? This was new.\nTrevor smiled faintly and responded to Hannah perfunctorily before heading upstairs.\nBack in the bedroom, he was about to open the envelope Celeste had left when Wynn called. After answering the call, he tossed the envelope aside and walked out the door.\nA short while later, the envelope slipped off the bed onto the floor.\nThat night, Trevor didn't return home.\nThe next day, Hannah noticed the envelope on the floor when she was cleaning. Recognizing it as the one Celeste had asked her to hand over, she assumed Trevor had already seen it and placed it in a nearby drawer.\n\u2026\nRight after getting off the plane, Celeste went home and began packing her belongings. She had accumulated quite a few things in the house since she'd been living there for six years, after all. But she only took a few sets of clothes, two sets of daily necessities, and some books that were related to her field of study back in college.\nAfter their marriage, Trevor had been depositing money for her and Jordyn into two separate accounts every month. One account was hers, and the other was Jordyn's.\nHowever, Celeste was used to spending her own money only. She had never touched the money in Jordyn's account. Because she loved Trevor, whenever she went shopping and saw clothes, shoes, cufflinks, or ties that suited him, she couldn't help but buy them.\nIn contrast, she didn't have many expenses on a daily basis because all she did was go to work. Her heart and mind were always focused on Trevor and Jordyn. She wanted to give them the best of everything.\nMost of the money Trevor deposited into her bank account was spent on him and Jordyn.\nGiven this spending pattern, there shouldn't have been much money left in Celeste's account. But over the past year, her opportunities to buy things for Trevor and Jordyn had decreased significantly because they were in Andostan.\nNow, there were over three million dollars in her account. That amount might not matter to Trevor, but to her, it was no small sum. And since it was her money, Celeste didn't hesitate to transfer it out.\nShe left both cards behind, dragged her suitcase out the door, and didn't look back.\nCeleste had an apartment near her workplace, which was a little over 1,100 square feet. She'd bought it four years ago to support a friend who had been struggling to meet their sales targets. She had never lived there before.\nNow, the apartment came in handy. She had it cleaned regularly, so it wasn't dirty. After a quick tidy-up, it was ready to move in.\nAfter a long day, Celeste washed up and went to bed around 10:00 pm.\n\u2026\nThe shrill sound of an alarm jolted Celeste awake. Startled, her mind went blank for a moment.\nWhen she came to her senses, she realized that while it was 1:00 am here, it was 7:00 am in Andostan, where Trevor and Jordyn were. This was their usual breakfast time.\nEver since Jordyn had gone to live with Trevor in Andostan, Celeste had developed the habit of calling her at this time every day. As she was always exhausted from work and was used to going to bed early, she had set this alarm to ensure she wouldn't miss the call.\nAt first, Jordyn hadn't adapted well to living in Andostan and had missed her terribly. She had called Celeste constantly. But as time went on, the calls that used to be full of yearning and dependence had grown perfunctory and impatient.\nThe alarm was no longer necessary. She just hadn't been able to let go.\nSmiling bitterly, Celeste deleted the alarm and turned off her phone before going back to sleep.\n\u2026\nMeanwhile, Trevor and Jordyn were nearly done with breakfast. Though he knew Celeste usually called Jordyn at this time, he wasn't always home and hadn't paid much attention to the routine.\nHe noticed that Celeste hadn't called that day. The fact registered in his mind, but he didn't care. After finishing breakfast, he went upstairs to change.\nJordyn, finding Celeste increasingly annoying, had grown less fond of their calls. Upon realizing that Celeste hadn't called yet, she figured something must have come up.\nShe grabbed her backpack and bolted for the door.\nHannah hurried after her. \"Ms. Fleming, it's still early. There's no rush!\"\nJordyn ignored her and ran to the car happily. She was thrilled that Celeste hadn't called on time that day. If she stayed home, she might still have to talk to Celeste later. Well, she didn't want that!\n\u2026\nAfter getting married to Trevor, Celeste had joined Fleming Group for his sake. Now that she was planning to divorce him, she saw no reason to stay.\nThe next morning, Celeste handed her resignation letter to Zeke Jackson after arriving at the office.\nZeke was one of Trevor's personal secretaries. When he saw Celeste's resignation letter, he was extremely surprised.\nHe was one of the few in the company who knew about the relationship between Celeste and Trevor.\nAnyone familiar with Trevor knew that he didn't love Celeste. So, he had been cold to her and rarely went home after their marriage.\nTo get closer to and win over Trevor, Celeste had chosen to work at Fleming Group.\nHer initial goal was to become his personal secretary, but Trevor refused vehemently. Even when Arnold stepped in, he couldn't get Trevor to agree. In the end, Celeste had to settle for a position in the secretarial team, becoming one of Trevor's many ordinary secretaries.\nAt first, Zeke had worried that Celeste's presence in the secretarial team would create chaos. But to his surprise, she didn't bring them any trouble. Although Celeste used her position to get closer to Trevor, she was mindful of her timing and never overstepped her boundaries. \nOn the contrary, she worked diligently and performed exceptionally well, hoping to gain Trevor's respect. Whether during her pregnancy, childbirth, or any other time, she strictly adhered to company policies and never sought special treatment.\nOver the years, Celeste rose to become the head of the secretarial team. Zeke had observed her feelings for Trevor from the sidelines all the while. To be honest, he had never imagined she would resign one day. He felt skeptical about her willingly giving up her position.\nSomething must have happened between Celeste and Trevor for her to resign now. Zeke understood that this was something he wasn't privy to\u2014it must be something significant enough for Trevor to have ordered her to resign.\nWhile he found it a pity, Zeke maintained a professional tone. \"I acknowledge that I've received your resignation letter. I'll arrange for someone to take over your duties as soon as possible.\"\n\"Alright.\" Celeste nodded and returned to her workstation.\nAfter working for a while, Zeke started an online meeting with Trevor to report on company matters. As the conversation neared its end, he suddenly remembered Celeste's resignation. \n\"Oh, Mr. Fleming, there's one more thing\u2014\"\nAlthough Zeke had told Celeste he would quickly arrange for someone to take over her position, he wanted to gauge Trevor's thoughts on the matter first. If Trevor wanted Celeste out immediately, he would make the arrangements right away.\nBut as the words left his mouth, he remembered that when Celeste first joined the company, Trevor had explicitly stated that all matters regarding her employment should be handled per company regulations. He made it clear that there was no need to report anything to him since he wouldn't concern himself with her.\nAnd indeed, over the years, Trevor had never actively inquired about Celeste's work at the company.\nEven when he encountered her at work, he treated her like she was a complete stranger.\nWhen Celeste was set to be promoted a couple of years ago, the team had hesitated. Everyone was aware of Trevor's dislike for her. They had even brought it up with him to gauge his opinion back then.\nTrevor had frowned in annoyance and reiterated that he wouldn't interfere and that they should handle it according to company policy. He had emphasized that they shouldn't bring up Celeste's matters with him again.\nSeeing Zeke's hesitation, Trevor frowned. \"What is it?\"\nZeke snapped out of his thoughts and quickly replied, \"Oh, it's nothing.\"\nSince Trevor was already aware of Celeste's resignation but hadn't brought it up, it was clear that this matter wasn't important to him. So, Zeke decided to proceed as usual and handle the matter according to company regulations.\nWith that resolved, Trevor ended the call.\n\u2026\n\"What are you thinking about?\" At noon, a colleague patted Celeste on the shoulder.\nCeleste came back to her senses and smiled, shaking her head. \"Nothing.\"\n\"Don't you need to call your daughter today?\"\n\"No, not today.\"\nTypically, she called Jordyn twice a day\u2014once at 1:00 am and once at around 12:00 pm.\nHer colleagues at work were aware of this habit. What they didn't know was her daughter was the child she had with the company's CEO.\nAfter work, Celeste went to the supermarket. She bought some groceries and a few potted plants before heading home.\nAfter dinner, she browsed online for information about the upcoming technology exhibition. \nAfter that, she made a call. \"Please reserve a ticket for next month's tech exhibition for me.\"\n\"Are you sure?\" the person on the other end replied coolly. \"The last two times you asked me to reserve tickets, you didn't show up. Do you know how many people's lifelong dream is to get one of those tickets? You wasted them thoughtlessly.\"\nThe annual tech exhibition was a major event in the industry, and tickets were not easily obtainable.\nTheir company had a limited number of slots, and many IT elites working for them eagerly vied for the opportunity to attend it.\n\"If I don't show up to the exhibition this time, I will never ask you to reserve a ticket for me ever again,\" Celeste promised.\nThere was silence on the other end before the line disconnected. \nCeleste knew that he'd agreed. The corners of her mouth tugged upward into a smile. What she hadn't said was that she wanted to return to the company.\nThough she was one of the partners of her tech firm, she had stepped back during its early days to focus on marriage and family. Her decision had disrupted their development plans and cost them many opportunities.\nHer colleagues had been both angry and frustrated with her. Over the years, they had rarely been in contact.\nWhile Celeste was eager to return, she knew she had been out of the industry for too long. If she went back unprepared, she was worried she wouldn't be able to keep up with the company's current pace.\nSo, she planned to spend some time familiarizing herself with the industry's latest developments before making a concrete decision.\nFor the next few days, Celeste focused on her work during office hours and spent her evenings tending to her own matters. She didn't reach out to Jordyn or Trevor, and they didn't contact her either.\nCeleste wasn't surprised. For over half a year, her communication with them had been one-sided. They had only passively responded to her efforts.\n\u2026\nMeanwhile, in Andostan, Jordyn had developed the habit of calling Wynn first thing every morning.\nThat day, she called Wynn right after waking up as usual. However, the call didn't last long before she burst into tears.\nWynn had told her some bad news. \"I'm going back to the country soon.\"\nDevastated, Jordyn finished the call and immediately phoned Trevor. \"Dad, did you know about this?\"\nAt his office, Trevor flipped through some documents. \"Yes.\"\n\"When did you find out?\"\n\"It's been a while.\"\n\"Dad, you're so mean\u2026\" Jordyn hugged her pink stuffed pig and cried loudly. \"I don't want Wynn to leave. If she's not here, I don't want to go to school here anymore. I want to go back too!\"\nTrevor's tone remained even. \"It's already being arranged.\"\nJordyn didn't understand. \"W-What do you mean?\"\n\"We're going back next week.\"\nJordyn jumped out of bed in excitement. \"Really?\"\n\"Yes, really,\" Trevor replied.\n\"Then why didn't Wynn tell me just now?\"\n\"It was just finalized. She doesn't know yet.\"\nJordyn was ecstatic. \"Dad, let's keep this a secret from Wynn. We'll surprise her when we go back to the country, okay?\"\n\"Alright.\"\n\"You're the best, Dad! I love you so much!\"\nAfter hanging up, Jordyn was still overjoyed. She sang and danced on her bed.\nAfter a while, she suddenly thought of Celeste. For the past few days, she had been in a great mood because Celeste hadn't called her. In fact, to avoid talking to Celeste, she had deliberately left home early and even turned off her phone or kept it far away from her after school.\nBut after two days, she was worried that Celeste might get angry if she found out. So, she stopped doing that. To her surprise, Celeste hadn't called at all in the days that followed.\nAt first, she thought Celeste had discovered that she was deliberately avoiding her calls. But then she remembered that based on past experiences, that wasn't very likely. If Celeste knew she had done something wrong, she would immediately ask Jordyn to correct her wrongdoing instead of sulking and not calling.\nAfter all, she was the most important person to Celeste. Jordyn knew that Celeste loved her the most, so she didn't think that Celeste would purposely refrain from calling her simply because she was upset.\nAs Jordyn thought about this, she suddenly missed Celeste. It was the first time in days she had thought about Celeste, and she couldn't resist dialing Celeste's number.\nBut just as the call connected, she remembered that while she would get to see Wynn after returning to the country, Celeste would undoubtedly try every possible way to prevent her from meeting Wynn. She wouldn't be able to see Wynn whenever she wanted like she could now.\nThis thought dampened Jordyn's mood.\nIt was midnight in Celeste's time zone. She was already asleep when she was woken by the call. Upon seeing Jordyn's name on the screen, she was about to answer when the call abruptly disconnected.\nAlthough Celeste had written in her divorce agreement that she would relinquish custody of Jordyn, she still felt a sense of responsibility as her mother. Worried that something might have happened, Celeste immediately called back.\nWhen Jordyn saw the incoming call, she turned her head away and refused to answer.\nCeleste became more concerned and quickly called the landline at the villa.\nHannah answered promptly. After hearing Celeste's concerns, she reassured her, \"Ms. Fleming should be fine. She went to bed late last night and woke up late today. When I checked earlier, she was still asleep. I'll go upstairs to take a look and call you back.\"\nFeeling relieved, Celeste replied, \"Thank you.\"\nWhen Hannah went upstairs, Jordyn was already in the bathroom brushing her teeth.\nAfter Hannah relayed Celeste being worried about her, Jordyn lowered her head and lied, \"I accidentally hit the call button.\"\nHannah believed her and didn't doubt what she said. Seeing that Jordyn was still brushing her teeth, she went back downstairs to update Celeste that Jordyn was fine.\nJordyn watched as Hannah left. She huffed and finally felt a bit better.\nAfter hearing Hannah's reassurance, Celeste felt relieved too. Still, having been abruptly woken, she struggled to fall back asleep. She wasn't in great shape the next morning at work.\nThe envelope containing the divorce agreement was completely forgotten by Trevor after the phone call with Wynn.\nOn the day they returned to the country, Trevor packed the last document into his briefcase and ensured that nothing was left behind before heading downstairs.\n\"All set. Let's go.\"\nThe Lincoln stretch limousine departed from the villa and headed to the airport.\n\u2026\nThat night, at around 10:00 pm, the plane carrying Trevor and Jordyn landed on time. By the time they got home, it was nearly midnight. \nJordyn had fallen asleep before they arrived. When Trevor carried her upstairs, he passed the master bedroom and noticed the door was open, but the room was pitch black.\nAfter putting Jordyn on her bed and tucking her in, he returned to the master bedroom and turned on the light. Then, he glanced at the bed and found that it was empty\u2014Celeste wasn't there.\nJust then, the butler, Peter Hawk, came upstairs with his luggage. \nLoosening his tie, Trevor asked, \"Where is she?\"\nPeter replied, \"Mrs. Fleming is on a business trip.\"\nHalf a month ago, Peter hadn't been around when Celeste had left with her suitcase. The other maids told him that Celeste left with a suitcase, so he had assumed she was traveling for work.\nNow that he thought about it, this was unusual. Celeste rarely went on business trips. Even when she did, they typically lasted only two or three days.\nThis time, she had been gone for over two weeks.\n\"Alright,\" Trevor responded indifferently, asking no further questions.\n...\nThe next day, Celeste unexpectedly ran into Trevor at the company. She hadn't known that Trevor and Jordyn had returned to the country. Caught off guard by their sudden encounter, Celeste froze mid-step.\nTrevor also seemed slightly surprised to see her, but he assumed she had just returned from the business trip and didn't think much of it.\nHe passed by her coldly, his face expressionless. As usual, he treated her like she was a stranger and turned to enter the building.\nIn the past, if Celeste had found out that he'd suddenly come back, she would have been overjoyed. Even if she couldn't throw herself into his arms in such a scenario, she would have been very happy and excited. Her eyes would light up as she greeted him. \nEven if Trevor remained indifferent, she would have smiled and wished him good morning enthusiastically.\nBut now, Celeste merely glanced at his handsome face before lowering her eyes. There was no longer any trace of the joy and excitement she once felt.\nTrevor didn't notice any of this and was already walking away.\nWatching his tall and composed figure disappear into the building, Celeste wondered when he had returned. Since he was back, perhaps the matter of their divorce could soon be addressed.\nHaving resolved to go through with the divorce, Celeste didn't dwell on him further. After she returned to her workstation, she quickly immersed herself in her work.\nHalf an hour later, Zeke called her and instructed her to do something. \"Prepare two cups of coffee and take them to Mr. Fleming's office.\"\nIn the early days of her marriage, Celeste had learned that Trevor enjoyed coffee. In hopes of winning his favor, she had spent a great deal of effort studying how to brew it perfectly. Her efforts had paid off. After tasting her coffee, Trevor began to specifically request it, both at home and at the office.\nWhen she first realized he genuinely liked the coffee she made, Celeste had been thrilled. She naively believed it was the first step toward gaining his approval.\nBut she had underestimated his dislike and wariness of her. While he liked her coffee, that was all he liked. His attitude toward her remained cold and distant.\nEven when he wanted her coffee, he would have Zeke reach out to her. Once the coffee was prepared, someone else would pick it up for him. He never gave her the opportunity to approach him herself.\nOnly on rare occasions when no one else was available did she get the chance to deliver it to his office personally.\nThis time, it seemed she was to take the coffee directly to Trevor herself from Zeke's tone. After brewing the coffee, Celeste placed the cups on a tray and carried them to his office.\nThe door to his office was ajar.\nAs she approached and was about to knock on the door politely, she saw Wynn sitting on Trevor's lap. The two of them seemed to be locked in a passionate kiss.\nCeleste stopped in her tracks, her face turning pale.\nUpon seeing her, Wynn shot up from Trevor's lap, looking flustered.\nTrevor's expression darkened, and he questioned in an icy tone, \"Who allowed you to come in?\"\n..."

                  "text": "If your husband stayed cold around you, then his passion might have found someone else.\nCeleste looked into the restaurant - her husband wrapped his arms around his first love dotingly, while her daughter was giggling besides...she finally decided to let go.\nThe cheating husband, along with the daughter calling another woman \"mom\"\u2014she would throw them both out of her life!\n\nAfter seven years of marriage, my husband, Trevor, fell for another woman\u2014even our daughter wanted her as her new mom.\nI scoffed at the years I\u2019d wasted and handed him the divorce papers. Yet he dropped his usual aloofness, slamming me against the wall,\n\u201cDivorce? Not a chance.\u201d\n***\nWhen Celeste Rodriguez landed at the airport in Andostan, it was already past 9:00 pm.\nIt was her birthday. Her phone buzzed with messages from colleagues and friends\u2014but not a single one from her husband, Trevor Fleming.\nCeleste's smile faded.\nBy the time she reached the villa, it was already past 10:00 pm.\nHannah Lynd, the housekeeper looked startled. \"Mrs. Fleming... what a surprise.\"\n\"Where are Trevor and Jo?\" Celeste asked, handing over her luggage.\n\"Mr. Fleming isn\u2019t back yet. Miss Jordyn\u2019s upstairs playing.\"\nCeleste climbed the stairs. In her room, Jordyn sat in pajamas at her desk, completely absorbed.\n\"Jo?\" Celeste called.\nJordyn turned, her eyes lighting up. In a happy tone, she greeted, \"Mom!\"\nBut then she quickly got back to what she was doing earlier.\nCeleste walked over and hugged her tight, planting a kiss on her cheek. Yet the little one pushed her away and squirmed. \"Mom, I\u2019m busy.\" \nIt had been two months since Celeste last saw Jordyn. She missed her so much that no amount of kisses felt enough. She wanted to talk to Jordyn.\nShe noticed the necklace Jordyn was threading. \"Jo, are you making a seashell necklace?\"\n\"Mm-hm!\" Jordyn perked up visibly. \"Wynn's birthday is in a week. Dad and I picked and polished these ourselves. Pretty, right?\"\nCeleste\u2019s throat tightened. Jordyn didn\u2019t look up, only added brightly, \"Dad even got her a custom gift, tomorrow\u2014\"\nCeleste felt a pang in her chest and couldn't hold back anymore. \"Jo\u2026 Do you remember it's my birthday today?\"\n\"Huh?\" Jordyn glanced up briefly, then quickly looked back down at the string of beads in her hands, She complained, \"Mom, don\u2019t talk, Look, I messed up the bead order\u2014\"\nCeleste stood there in silence for a while, but Jordyn never looked back up. Finally, Celeste pursed her lips and left the room without another word.\nDownstairs, Hannah said, \"I called Mr. Fleming. He said he\u2019s busy tonight and you should rest first.\"\n\"I see.\" Celeste replied softly.\nShe hesitated, then called Trevor. It rang for a while before he answered.\nhis tone was indifferent as usual. \"I'm busy. Let's talk tomorrow\u2014\"\nA woman\u2019s voice chimed in: \"Trevor, who is it?\"\nWynn.\nCeleste gripped the phone tighter.\n\"No one important,\" Trevor answered her.\nBefore Celeste could say anything, Trevor had already hung up.\nCeleste stared at the screen. Two or three months apart, and this was all he had for her.\nAfter so many years of marriage, he\u2019d always been cold. Distant. Impatient. \nShe had got used to chasing after him, calling again, begging for time. Yet tonight, she didn\u2019t bother. \nPerhaps she was just too tired.\n\nThe next morning, Celeste thought it over and decided to call Trevor again.\nThere was a time difference of about 17 or 18 hours between Andostan and their home country. In Andostan, today was her actual birthday.\nShe didn\u2019t just come here for Jordyn. She wanted one thing: a family meal. Her only birthday wish.\nYet, Trevor didn\u2019t answer.\nA long time later, he texted: What\u2019s up?\nShe replied: Lunch today? Just the three of us.\nTrevor answered: Okay. Send the address.\nAlright, she typed back.\nThat was it. No acknowledgment. No \u201cHappy birthday.\u201d She wasn\u2019t surprised. But it still stung.\nAs she headed downstairs, she overheard Jordyn talking with Hannah.\n\"Aren't you happy that Mrs. Fleming is here, sweetie?\" Hannah asked.\n\"Dad and I promised to take Wynn to the beach tomorrow. If Mom comes, it'll be weird. She\u2019s always mean to Wynn.\"\n\"Mrs. Fleming is still your mom, sweetie. That\u2019s hurtful.\"\n\"I know, but Dad and I like Wynn more. Can't Wynn be my mom instead?\"\nCeleste froze.\nShe had raised Jordyn herself most of the time. But over the past two years, the more time Jordyn spent with Trevor, the more attached she became to him. When Trevor came to Andostan to expand his business last year, Jordyn had insisted on coming along.\nCeleste was reluctant and had hoped Jordyn would stay by her side. But she couldn't bear to see Jordyn upset, so she agreed.\nAnd now, Jordyn didn\u2019t even want her as her mom anymore.\nCeleste stood frozen in place, her face pale. To think that she had pushed aside her work to come to Andostan with the intention of spending more time with Jordyn.\nNow, it seemed unnecessary.\nShe walked back to her room, pale and quiet, then repacked the gifts she\u2019d brought.\nLater, Hannah texted: Madame, I took Jordyn out. Let me know if you need anything.\nCeleste sat on the bed, feeling hollow and lost inside. She had abandoned her work and made this trip, only to find no one wanted her here.\nHer arrival was nothing but a joke.\n\nAfter a long while, she left the villa. Aimlessly, she drove around in this foreign yet familiar country.\nBy noon, she remembered she had planned to have lunch with Trevor and Jordyn. As she recalled what she had overheard in the morning, she hesitated about whether to go home and pick up Jordyn. \nThen, a text from Trevor came: Something came up. Lunch\u2019s canceled.\nCeleste stared at it.\nShe should\u2019ve known. Trevor always canceled on her.  His work, friends, and everything else always came before her, his wife.\nOnce, she\u2019d cry. Today, she just felt\u2026 empty.\nCeleste was at an utter loss. She had come all this way excitedly only to be met with indifference from both Trevor and Jordyn.\nAimlessly, she drove around. Eventually, she found herself outside an old favorite restaurant which she and Trevor used to frequent.\nJust as she was about to walk in, she saw them.\nTrevor. Jordyn. Wynn.\nWynn sat next to Jordyn, laughing, feeding the little one the pastries she had taken a bite out of. Jordyn giggled, with her legs swinging around happily. Trevor smiled as he served food to both of them, but his gaze never left Wynn.\nWhat a happy family of three!\nSo this was his \"something came up.\"\nAnd this was the daughter she had carried for ten long months and nearly lost her life to bring into this world.\nCeleste laughed humorlessly. She stood there watching for a long time. Finally, she turned and drove away.\n\nBack at the villa, Celeste drafted the divorce agreement.\nTrevor had been her teenage dream\u2014but he had never truly seen her. If not for that one night and his grandfather Arnold Fleming\u2019s pressure, he never would\u2019ve married her. She thought loving him hard enough would be enough, but seven years proved otherwise.\nFor a long time, she felt lucky to have Jo\u2014her only source of comfort. But now, even Jo didn\u2019t seem to want her.\nThat was it.\nShe was done\u2014with the marriage, the lies, the thankless role of wife and mother. It was time to leave all this behind\u2014and reclaim the promising life she'd given up!\nShe sealed the divorce papers, handed them to Hannah, then grabbed her suitcase and walked out, bound for the airport. On the way, she finally dialed the number she\u2019d been avoiding for months.\nThe line rang once. Twice. A click.\n\u201cHello?\u201d\nShe took a breath, steady and sharp.\u201cThat offer still stand?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d\n...\nAt around 9:00 pm, Trevor and Jordyn returned home.\nJordyn clung to the hem of Trevor's coat and got out of the car sluggishly. Because Celeste was at home, she was reluctant to return that night.\nBut Wynn had said that Celeste came specifically to be with her and Trevor, and if they didn't return, she would be sad. Trevor also said that if they didn't go home that night, Celeste would definitely insist on joining them on their outing to the sea the next day.\nReluctantly, Jordyn agreed to come home.\nStill worried, she muttered gloomily, \"Dad, what if Mom insists on tagging along with us tomorrow?\"\n\"She won't,\" Trevor replied confidently.\nIn all the years they'd been married, Celeste had always tried to find ways to spend more time with him. But she was also sensible. As long as he made his stance clear, she wouldn't dare make him upset.\nIn Jordyn's memory, Celeste always listened to Trevor. Since he said she wouldn't, she felt reassured. As a result, her mood lifted. She made her way into the villa cheerfully and told Hannah she wanted to take a bath.\n\"Sure, sure,\" Hannah replied to Jordyn. Then, she remembered Celeste's instructions and handed an envelope to Trevor. \"Mr. Fleming, this is from Mrs. Fleming. She asked me to give it to you.\"\nTrevor took the envelope and asked casually, \"Where is she?\"\n\"Mrs. Fleming packed up and went back to the country this afternoon. Didn't you know?\" Hannah responded.\nTrevor paused mid-step as he was heading upstairs. He turned back, feeling a little surprised. \"Has she gone back?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nWhy had Celeste suddenly come to Andostan? Trevor hadn't given her a chance to tell him about it. He hadn't cared to ask either. Upon learning she'd left, he didn't dwell on it.\nJordyn was a little surprised too. When she heard the news, she felt a small twinge of disappointment. She'd been thinking that even if Celeste didn't join them for the outing tomorrow, it might be nice to have her around at home in the evening.\nPolishing the seashells made her hands hurt\u2014she had been counting on Celeste's help in finishing the necklace.\nThough it had been months since Trevor and Celeste had seen each other, she had made the effort to visit but only to leave without seeing him in person. Hannah recalled Celeste's grim expression as she left and thought that things felt a little off.\nShe couldn't help but say, \"Mr. Fleming, Mrs. Fleming looked upset when she left. She seemed angry.\"\nHannah had assumed Celeste's sudden departure was due to an urgent matter. Upon realizing Trevor hadn't known she'd left, she began to feel something was amiss.\n\"Angry?\" Trevor repeated in his mind. \nIn his presence, Celeste had always been patient and accommodating. So, she could get angry too? This was new.\nTrevor smiled faintly and responded to Hannah perfunctorily before heading upstairs.\nBack in the bedroom, he was about to open the envelope Celeste had left when Wynn called. After answering the call, he tossed the envelope aside and walked out the door.\nA short while later, the envelope slipped off the bed onto the floor.\nThat night, Trevor didn't return home.\nThe next day, Hannah noticed the envelope on the floor when she was cleaning. Recognizing it as the one Celeste had asked her to hand over, she assumed Trevor had already seen it and placed it in a nearby drawer.\n\u2026\nRight after getting off the plane, Celeste went home and began packing her belongings. She had accumulated quite a few things in the house since she'd been living there for six years, after all. But she only took a few sets of clothes, two sets of daily necessities, and some books that were related to her field of study back in college.\nAfter their marriage, Trevor had been depositing money for her and Jordyn into two separate accounts every month. One account was hers, and the other was Jordyn's.\nHowever, Celeste was used to spending her own money only. She had never touched the money in Jordyn's account. Because she loved Trevor, whenever she went shopping and saw clothes, shoes, cufflinks, or ties that suited him, she couldn't help but buy them.\nIn contrast, she didn't have many expenses on a daily basis because all she did was go to work. Her heart and mind were always focused on Trevor and Jordyn. She wanted to give them the best of everything.\nMost of the money Trevor deposited into her bank account was spent on him and Jordyn.\nGiven this spending pattern, there shouldn't have been much money left in Celeste's account. But over the past year, her opportunities to buy things for Trevor and Jordyn had decreased significantly because they were in Andostan.\nNow, there were over three million dollars in her account. That amount might not matter to Trevor, but to her, it was no small sum. And since it was her money, Celeste didn't hesitate to transfer it out.\nShe left both cards behind, dragged her suitcase out the door, and didn't look back.\nCeleste had an apartment near her workplace, which was a little over 1,100 square feet. She'd bought it four years ago to support a friend who had been struggling to meet their sales targets. She had never lived there before.\nNow, the apartment came in handy. She had it cleaned regularly, so it wasn't dirty. After a quick tidy-up, it was ready to move in.\nAfter a long day, Celeste washed up and went to bed around 10:00 pm.\n\u2026\nThe shrill sound of an alarm jolted Celeste awake. Startled, her mind went blank for a moment.\nWhen she came to her senses, she realized that while it was 1:00 am here, it was 7:00 am in Andostan, where Trevor and Jordyn were. This was their usual breakfast time.\nEver since Jordyn had gone to live with Trevor in Andostan, Celeste had developed the habit of calling her at this time every day. As she was always exhausted from work and was used to going to bed early, she had set this alarm to ensure she wouldn't miss the call.\nAt first, Jordyn hadn't adapted well to living in Andostan and had missed her terribly. She had called Celeste constantly. But as time went on, the calls that used to be full of yearning and dependence had grown perfunctory and impatient.\nThe alarm was no longer necessary. She just hadn't been able to let go.\nSmiling bitterly, Celeste deleted the alarm and turned off her phone before going back to sleep.\n\u2026\nMeanwhile, Trevor and Jordyn were nearly done with breakfast. Though he knew Celeste usually called Jordyn at this time, he wasn't always home and hadn't paid much attention to the routine.\nHe noticed that Celeste hadn't called that day. The fact registered in his mind, but he didn't care. After finishing breakfast, he went upstairs to change.\nJordyn, finding Celeste increasingly annoying, had grown less fond of their calls. Upon realizing that Celeste hadn't called yet, she figured something must have come up.\nShe grabbed her backpack and bolted for the door.\nHannah hurried after her. \"Ms. Fleming, it's still early. There's no rush!\"\nJordyn ignored her and ran to the car happily. She was thrilled that Celeste hadn't called on time that day. If she stayed home, she might still have to talk to Celeste later. Well, she didn't want that!\n\u2026\nAfter getting married to Trevor, Celeste had joined Fleming Group for his sake. Now that she was planning to divorce him, she saw no reason to stay.\nThe next morning, Celeste handed her resignation letter to Zeke Jackson after arriving at the office.\nZeke was one of Trevor's personal secretaries. When he saw Celeste's resignation letter, he was extremely surprised.\nHe was one of the few in the company who knew about the relationship between Celeste and Trevor.\nAnyone familiar with Trevor knew that he didn't love Celeste. So, he had been cold to her and rarely went home after their marriage.\nTo get closer to and win over Trevor, Celeste had chosen to work at Fleming Group.\nHer initial goal was to become his personal secretary, but Trevor refused vehemently. Even when Arnold stepped in, he couldn't get Trevor to agree. In the end, Celeste had to settle for a position in the secretarial team, becoming one of Trevor's many ordinary secretaries.\nAt first, Zeke had worried that Celeste's presence in the secretarial team would create chaos. But to his surprise, she didn't bring them any trouble. Although Celeste used her position to get closer to Trevor, she was mindful of her timing and never overstepped her boundaries. \nOn the contrary, she worked diligently and performed exceptionally well, hoping to gain Trevor's respect. Whether during her pregnancy, childbirth, or any other time, she strictly adhered to company policies and never sought special treatment.\nOver the years, Celeste rose to become the head of the secretarial team. Zeke had observed her feelings for Trevor from the sidelines all the while. To be honest, he had never imagined she would resign one day. He felt skeptical about her willingly giving up her position.\nSomething must have happened between Celeste and Trevor for her to resign now. Zeke understood that this was something he wasn't privy to\u2014it must be something significant enough for Trevor to have ordered her to resign.\nWhile he found it a pity, Zeke maintained a professional tone. \"I acknowledge that I've received your resignation letter. I'll arrange for someone to take over your duties as soon as possible.\"\n\"Alright.\" Celeste nodded and returned to her workstation.\nAfter working for a while, Zeke started an online meeting with Trevor to report on company matters. As the conversation neared its end, he suddenly remembered Celeste's resignation. \n\"Oh, Mr. Fleming, there's one more thing\u2014\"\nAlthough Zeke had told Celeste he would quickly arrange for someone to take over her position, he wanted to gauge Trevor's thoughts on the matter first. If Trevor wanted Celeste out immediately, he would make the arrangements right away.\nBut as the words left his mouth, he remembered that when Celeste first joined the company, Trevor had explicitly stated that all matters regarding her employment should be handled per company regulations. He made it clear that there was no need to report anything to him since he wouldn't concern himself with her.\nAnd indeed, over the years, Trevor had never actively inquired about Celeste's work at the company.\nEven when he encountered her at work, he treated her like she was a complete stranger.\nWhen Celeste was set to be promoted a couple of years ago, the team had hesitated. Everyone was aware of Trevor's dislike for her. They had even brought it up with him to gauge his opinion back then.\nTrevor had frowned in annoyance and reiterated that he wouldn't interfere and that they should handle it according to company policy. He had emphasized that they shouldn't bring up Celeste's matters with him again.\nSeeing Zeke's hesitation, Trevor frowned. \"What is it?\"\nZeke snapped out of his thoughts and quickly replied, \"Oh, it's nothing.\"\nSince Trevor was already aware of Celeste's resignation but hadn't brought it up, it was clear that this matter wasn't important to him. So, Zeke decided to proceed as usual and handle the matter according to company regulations.\nWith that resolved, Trevor ended the call.\n\u2026\n\"What are you thinking about?\" At noon, a colleague patted Celeste on the shoulder.\nCeleste came back to her senses and smiled, shaking her head. \"Nothing.\"\n\"Don't you need to call your daughter today?\"\n\"No, not today.\"\nTypically, she called Jordyn twice a day\u2014once at 1:00 am and once at around 12:00 pm.\nHer colleagues at work were aware of this habit. What they didn't know was her daughter was the child she had with the company's CEO.\nAfter work, Celeste went to the supermarket. She bought some groceries and a few potted plants before heading home.\nAfter dinner, she browsed online for information about the upcoming technology exhibition. \nAfter that, she made a call. \"Please reserve a ticket for next month's tech exhibition for me.\"\n\"Are you sure?\" the person on the other end replied coolly. \"The last two times you asked me to reserve tickets, you didn't show up. Do you know how many people's lifelong dream is to get one of those tickets? You wasted them thoughtlessly.\"\nThe annual tech exhibition was a major event in the industry, and tickets were not easily obtainable.\nTheir company had a limited number of slots, and many IT elites working for them eagerly vied for the opportunity to attend it.\n\"If I don't show up to the exhibition this time, I will never ask you to reserve a ticket for me ever again,\" Celeste promised.\nThere was silence on the other end before the line disconnected. \nCeleste knew that he'd agreed. The corners of her mouth tugged upward into a smile. What she hadn't said was that she wanted to return to the company.\nThough she was one of the partners of her tech firm, she had stepped back during its early days to focus on marriage and family. Her decision had disrupted their development plans and cost them many opportunities.\nHer colleagues had been both angry and frustrated with her. Over the years, they had rarely been in contact.\nWhile Celeste was eager to return, she knew she had been out of the industry for too long. If she went back unprepared, she was worried she wouldn't be able to keep up with the company's current pace.\nSo, she planned to spend some time familiarizing herself with the industry's latest developments before making a concrete decision.\nFor the next few days, Celeste focused on her work during office hours and spent her evenings tending to her own matters. She didn't reach out to Jordyn or Trevor, and they didn't contact her either.\nCeleste wasn't surprised. For over half a year, her communication with them had been one-sided. They had only passively responded to her efforts.\n\u2026\nMeanwhile, in Andostan, Jordyn had developed the habit of calling Wynn first thing every morning.\nThat day, she called Wynn right after waking up as usual. However, the call didn't last long before she burst into tears.\nWynn had told her some bad news. \"I'm going back to the country soon.\"\nDevastated, Jordyn finished the call and immediately phoned Trevor. \"Dad, did you know about this?\"\nAt his office, Trevor flipped through some documents. \"Yes.\"\n\"When did you find out?\"\n\"It's been a while.\"\n\"Dad, you're so mean\u2026\" Jordyn hugged her pink stuffed pig and cried loudly. \"I don't want Wynn to leave. If she's not here, I don't want to go to school here anymore. I want to go back too!\"\nTrevor's tone remained even. \"It's already being arranged.\"\nJordyn didn't understand. \"W-What do you mean?\"\n\"We're going back next week.\"\nJordyn jumped out of bed in excitement. \"Really?\"\n\"Yes, really,\" Trevor replied.\n\"Then why didn't Wynn tell me just now?\"\n\"It was just finalized. She doesn't know yet.\"\nJordyn was ecstatic. \"Dad, let's keep this a secret from Wynn. We'll surprise her when we go back to the country, okay?\"\n\"Alright.\"\n\"You're the best, Dad! I love you so much!\"\nAfter hanging up, Jordyn was still overjoyed. She sang and danced on her bed.\nAfter a while, she suddenly thought of Celeste. For the past few days, she had been in a great mood because Celeste hadn't called her. In fact, to avoid talking to Celeste, she had deliberately left home early and even turned off her phone or kept it far away from her after school.\nBut after two days, she was worried that Celeste might get angry if she found out. So, she stopped doing that. To her surprise, Celeste hadn't called at all in the days that followed.\nAt first, she thought Celeste had discovered that she was deliberately avoiding her calls. But then she remembered that based on past experiences, that wasn't very likely. If Celeste knew she had done something wrong, she would immediately ask Jordyn to correct her wrongdoing instead of sulking and not calling.\nAfter all, she was the most important person to Celeste. Jordyn knew that Celeste loved her the most, so she didn't think that Celeste would purposely refrain from calling her simply because she was upset.\nAs Jordyn thought about this, she suddenly missed Celeste. It was the first time in days she had thought about Celeste, and she couldn't resist dialing Celeste's number.\nBut just as the call connected, she remembered that while she would get to see Wynn after returning to the country, Celeste would undoubtedly try every possible way to prevent her from meeting Wynn. She wouldn't be able to see Wynn whenever she wanted like she could now.\nThis thought dampened Jordyn's mood.\nIt was midnight in Celeste's time zone. She was already asleep when she was woken by the call. Upon seeing Jordyn's name on the screen, she was about to answer when the call abruptly disconnected.\nAlthough Celeste had written in her divorce agreement that she would relinquish custody of Jordyn, she still felt a sense of responsibility as her mother. Worried that something might have happened, Celeste immediately called back.\nWhen Jordyn saw the incoming call, she turned her head away and refused to answer.\nCeleste became more concerned and quickly called the landline at the villa.\nHannah answered promptly. After hearing Celeste's concerns, she reassured her, \"Ms. Fleming should be fine. She went to bed late last night and woke up late today. When I checked earlier, she was still asleep. I'll go upstairs to take a look and call you back.\"\nFeeling relieved, Celeste replied, \"Thank you.\"\nWhen Hannah went upstairs, Jordyn was already in the bathroom brushing her teeth.\nAfter Hannah relayed Celeste being worried about her, Jordyn lowered her head and lied, \"I accidentally hit the call button.\"\nHannah believed her and didn't doubt what she said. Seeing that Jordyn was still brushing her teeth, she went back downstairs to update Celeste that Jordyn was fine.\nJordyn watched as Hannah left. She huffed and finally felt a bit better.\nAfter hearing Hannah's reassurance, Celeste felt relieved too. Still, having been abruptly woken, she struggled to fall back asleep. She wasn't in great shape the next morning at work.\nThe envelope containing the divorce agreement was completely forgotten by Trevor after the phone call with Wynn.\nOn the day they returned to the country, Trevor packed the last document into his briefcase and ensured that nothing was left behind before heading downstairs.\n\"All set. Let's go.\"\nThe Lincoln stretch limousine departed from the villa and headed to the airport.\n\u2026\nThat night, at around 10:00 pm, the plane carrying Trevor and Jordyn landed on time. By the time they got home, it was nearly midnight. \nJordyn had fallen asleep before they arrived. When Trevor carried her upstairs, he passed the master bedroom and noticed the door was open, but the room was pitch black.\nAfter putting Jordyn on her bed and tucking her in, he returned to the master bedroom and turned on the light. Then, he glanced at the bed and found that it was empty\u2014Celeste wasn't there.\nJust then, the butler, Peter Hawk, came upstairs with his luggage. \nLoosening his tie, Trevor asked, \"Where is she?\"\nPeter replied, \"Mrs. Fleming is on a business trip.\"\nHalf a month ago, Peter hadn't been around when Celeste had left with her suitcase. The other maids told him that Celeste left with a suitcase, so he had assumed she was traveling for work.\nNow that he thought about it, this was unusual. Celeste rarely went on business trips. Even when she did, they typically lasted only two or three days.\nThis time, she had been gone for over two weeks.\n\"Alright,\" Trevor responded indifferently, asking no further questions.\n...\nThe next day, Celeste unexpectedly ran into Trevor at the company. She hadn't known that Trevor and Jordyn had returned to the country. Caught off guard by their sudden encounter, Celeste froze mid-step.\nTrevor also seemed slightly surprised to see her, but he assumed she had just returned from the business trip and didn't think much of it.\nHe passed by her coldly, his face expressionless. As usual, he treated her like she was a stranger and turned to enter the building.\nIn the past, if Celeste had found out that he'd suddenly come back, she would have been overjoyed. Even if she couldn't throw herself into his arms in such a scenario, she would have been very happy and excited. Her eyes would light up as she greeted him. \nEven if Trevor remained indifferent, she would have smiled and wished him good morning enthusiastically.\nBut now, Celeste merely glanced at his handsome face before lowering her eyes. There was no longer any trace of the joy and excitement she once felt.\nTrevor didn't notice any of this and was already walking away.\nWatching his tall and composed figure disappear into the building, Celeste wondered when he had returned. Since he was back, perhaps the matter of their divorce could soon be addressed.\nHaving resolved to go through with the divorce, Celeste didn't dwell on him further. After she returned to her workstation, she quickly immersed herself in her work.\nHalf an hour later, Zeke called her and instructed her to do something. \"Prepare two cups of coffee and take them to Mr. Fleming's office.\"\nIn the early days of her marriage, Celeste had learned that Trevor enjoyed coffee. In hopes of winning his favor, she had spent a great deal of effort studying how to brew it perfectly. Her efforts had paid off. After tasting her coffee, Trevor began to specifically request it, both at home and at the office.\nWhen she first realized he genuinely liked the coffee she made, Celeste had been thrilled. She naively believed it was the first step toward gaining his approval.\nBut she had underestimated his dislike and wariness of her. While he liked her coffee, that was all he liked. His attitude toward her remained cold and distant.\nEven when he wanted her coffee, he would have Zeke reach out to her. Once the coffee was prepared, someone else would pick it up for him. He never gave her the opportunity to approach him herself.\nOnly on rare occasions when no one else was available did she get the chance to deliver it to his office personally.\nThis time, it seemed she was to take the coffee directly to Trevor herself from Zeke's tone. After brewing the coffee, Celeste placed the cups on a tray and carried them to his office.\nThe door to his office was ajar.\nAs she approached and was about to knock on the door politely, she saw Wynn sitting on Trevor's lap. The two of them seemed to be locked in a passionate kiss.\nCeleste stopped in her tracks, her face turning pale.\nUpon seeing her, Wynn shot up from Trevor's lap, looking flustered.\nTrevor's expression darkened, and he questioned in an icy tone, \"Who allowed you to come in?\"\n..."
